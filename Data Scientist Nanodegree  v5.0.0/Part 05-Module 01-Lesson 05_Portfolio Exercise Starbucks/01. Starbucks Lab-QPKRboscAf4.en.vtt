00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
So, the take-home assessment

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.660
is one that we've used in the past, I took it myself.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.300
It mimics an individual experiment.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.620
So, it mimics sending an offer to a certain group of individuals,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.935
and also there's a control group involved.

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:26.404
There are a number of features that are

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:30.035
presented without a description of what those features are.

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:31.725
They're V_1 through V_7.

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:35.510
The idea is to first go through the data,

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:37.479
find what you have to work with there.

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.654
Then secondly, more importantly,

00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:43.109
find if this offer had an incremental response.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.539
So, incremental response is one of the things that we're always looking for,

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.530
not just how much of a spike did you see because you sent an offer.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.060
We know advertising works,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.250
but really how much differently did someone

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.634
behave because they received this offer than they would have anyway.

00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:01.519
Identifying the incremental response above and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.939
beyond what the background is always the goal.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.819
The exciting part is the modeling,

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:11.089
and the exciting part is discovering that group of people who really love this offer,

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.609
who really go above and beyond what they would've done anyway, without the analysis,

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:19.700
without understanding the basics of the data,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.609
and what it's trying to tell you first.

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.540
You don't have grounds for building that model.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.350
The setup of the experiment is quite realistic.

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:31.414
The actual data, and the actual outcomes are simulated.

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:35.930
Common mistake for problems like this one is to jump right in and

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.030
assume that the data is telling you what the column names seem to tell you at face value.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.575
If you saw a column said, 'price',

00:01:43.575 --> 00:01:47.450
you might just assume that that is the cost of an item,

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.060
but you have to start digging in a little bit deeper and ask,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.025
"Well, is that the cost that Starbucks paid?

00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:56.344
Is that the cost that the customer paid?

00:01:56.344 --> 00:01:59.984
Is that the cost of the customer actually paid after-tax?"

00:01:59.984 --> 00:02:04.504
Digging in, and verifying that not only the data is

00:02:04.504 --> 00:02:08.780
usable will form the regular data margin,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.360
but the data is telling a story that's

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.595
consistent with what you are expecting in your head.

00:02:14.594 --> 00:02:18.719
What you expect in your head is going to get translated to what you build into the model.
