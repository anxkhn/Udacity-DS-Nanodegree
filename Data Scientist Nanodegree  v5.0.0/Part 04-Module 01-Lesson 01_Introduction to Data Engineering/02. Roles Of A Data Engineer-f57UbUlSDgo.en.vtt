00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.910
Let's talk about the roles of a data engineer which can actually

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.375
vary a lot depending on where you work and the size of your company.

00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:16.574
At larger companies, there are usually

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:20.355
dedicated data engineers who pull from many sources,

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:23.914
and pipeline the data into a usable form.

00:00:23.914 --> 00:00:28.674
These sources can include website logs, smartphone app logs,

00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:31.280
user data, transaction data,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.140
sensor data, mechanical data, and much more.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.685
Analysts can then use these results for dashboard visualizations,

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:42.719
predictive models, business decisions,

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.429
recommendations, or other data science applications.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.969
Smaller companies often don't have the resources for a dedicated data engineer.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.679
For these companies, a data scientist might have

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.409
more than one role taking on at least some of the responsibilities of a data engineer.

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.310
As data scientists, we focus much of our time on building mathematical,

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.530
machine learning, and domain specific business skills.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.954
However, improving our engineering skills sometimes gets little attention.

00:01:13.954 --> 00:01:17.569
This course will mimic the kind of work you'll do as

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:21.509
a data scientist in a smaller company and a larger company.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.715
The first section focuses on writing data pipelines.

00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:28.829
You'll practice pulling data from various sources,

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.349
transforming the data, and then storing the results in a database.

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:34.979
In the next section,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.310
you'll create machine learning pipelines to

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.575
streamline data preparation and model building,

00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:44.290
and at the end of the lesson is a really cool project,

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.955
where you can put what you've learned into practice.

00:01:47.954 --> 00:01:49.954
Before we start coding,

00:01:49.954 --> 00:01:54.719
let's introduce our industry partner for the data engineering project.
