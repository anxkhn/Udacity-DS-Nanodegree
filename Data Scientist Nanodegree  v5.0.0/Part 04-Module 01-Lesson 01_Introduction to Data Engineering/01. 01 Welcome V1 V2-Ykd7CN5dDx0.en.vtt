00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.060
Welcome to this course on Data Engineering for data scientists.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.410
We'll introduce you to some of the skills that data engineers use to gather and

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.810
manipulate data and how you can incorporate

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.713
those skills into your work as a data scientist.

00:00:18.713 --> 00:00:22.429
So, what exactly do data engineers do?

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:27.600
Well, data engineers gather all kinds of data from different sources,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.395
a process and combine this data,

00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:35.144
and then store the clean data in a place that can be easily accessed.

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:39.430
The goal is to get everything ready so that a data scientist,

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.109
business analyst, or really anyone at

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.810
the company can use this data without having to do much wrangling.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.090
Data engineers automate this whole process writing

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.420
software programs called data pipelines.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.405
These engineers work with large systems that they build test and maintain with code.

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:02.314
More recently, data engineers are being asked to

00:01:02.314 --> 00:01:05.750
automate and scale machine learning algorithms as well.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.469
They're actually much closer to software engineers than they are to data scientists.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.900
As a data scientist,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.980
it's important that you have at least some data engineering skills.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.560
You'll often be communicating with engineers about

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.930
what data you need and what format the data needs to be in.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.860
I'll be the first to admit that

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.075
the most fascinating part of data science for me is machine learning,

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:34.505
but you can't build features and train

00:01:34.504 --> 00:01:38.375
a machine learning model with messy poorly formatted data.

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:41.564
That's where data engineering comes into play.

00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:46.069
Let's talk in more detail about what exactly the role

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.719
of a data engineer is and what you'll be doing in this lesson.
