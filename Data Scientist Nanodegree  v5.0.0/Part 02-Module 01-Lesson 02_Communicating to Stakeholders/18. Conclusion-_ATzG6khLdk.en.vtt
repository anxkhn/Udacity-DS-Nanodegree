With that, you're ready to take on your project.

You can find a link to my full post from

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:09.824
the analysis of Stack Overflow survey results in the link below.

00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:12.478
Communication is key to any job,

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:16.335
but it's especially so in those related to making the most of data.

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:20.099
Data holds the answer to take questions on a massive level,

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.539
not just one opinion.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.710
Making the most of data means communicating the results of your analysis,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.100
and you are now ready to do just that.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.580
Use the ideas of this lesson to guide your post.

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.479
Ultimately, have fun and make the post you're on.
