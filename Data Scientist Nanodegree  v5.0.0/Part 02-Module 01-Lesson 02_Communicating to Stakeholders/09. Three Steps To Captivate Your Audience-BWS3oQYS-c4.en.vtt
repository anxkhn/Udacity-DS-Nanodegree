00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.155
In the following sections,

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:10.470
we'll go over three steps for creating a great blog post.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.860
First, pull in and engage your reader.

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:18.149
Second, keep the reader engaged through strong storytelling,

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:21.414
personal voice, and the right article structure.

00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:25.019
Third, provide an ending that leaves the reader with

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.120
your desired takeaways and a call to

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.820
action for how they can use what they've just learned.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.539
Let's take a closer look at each of these points and how

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.839
you can get started with putting together a great post for your readers.
