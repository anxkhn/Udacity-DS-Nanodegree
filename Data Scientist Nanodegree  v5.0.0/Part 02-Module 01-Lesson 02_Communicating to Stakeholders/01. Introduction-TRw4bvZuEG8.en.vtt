00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.605
One of your most crucial roles

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:12.480
as a data scientist is clearly communicating your insights to different audiences,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.220
whether that's through code,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.649
data visualizations, written or spoken communication.

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:23.429
Even if you build the best models or find groundbreaking results,

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.129
your work can fall short of its full value to

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:30.479
a company if you fail to effectively communicate to stakeholders.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.880
For this reason, the last bit of information we will

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.060
cover is how to build a portfolio that demonstrates

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.320
your technical and communication skills by showcasing

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.950
your project on GitHub and organizing your results and thoughts together in a blog post.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.590
I will show you how to leverage Medium and GitHub to share

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.920
your insights with others and begin putting together your portfolio.
