00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
In this video, we're going to go through how you can

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.910
post your work for others to see on GitHub.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.755
In this first part, you can see that in my repositories,

00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:11.865
I have a Stack Overflow project

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.995
related to the information we worked through in the previous lesson.

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:17.939
In order to post my work as you see here,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.234
I went through a few steps that you're going to work through with me in this video.

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:24.719
If we go back to the repositories page,

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.404
you'll see that there's a button here called New.

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:29.205
By clicking the New button,

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:31.619
you can type in the name of the repository

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.164
that you'd like to create related to your project,

00:00:34.164 --> 00:00:36.924
a short description, and if you have a paid account,

00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:41.799
you can choose whether you'd like that to be a private or public repository.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.984
Once you create the repository,

00:00:44.984 --> 00:00:47.079
you'll see this page with directions about

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.795
how you can get started with this on your local machine.

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:54.969
By copying this portion right here or clicking the README portion,

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.835
you can create your own repository.

00:00:57.835 --> 00:01:00.054
I'm going to copy this URL,

00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:02.394
and then by going to my local machine,

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:07.659
I'm on my desktop and by using git clone and typing the URL,

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.329
I can clone this repository to my local.

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:13.864
It gives me a warning that says there's nothing in this which is fine,

00:01:13.864 --> 00:01:15.299
because if you're just getting started,

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.159
you can move all your project files into this repository later.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.914
Now, the Project-1 here is something that we can move into,

00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:26.010
which you can see is empty.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.040
Let's say we add a few files.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.280
So now, we have these couple of files,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.390
and we might want to add those to our project.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.894
First, we'll use the git add command,

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:38.849
and we can use a star if we just want to add everything that's in the repository.

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:41.574
Otherwise, we can individually list them.

00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:43.314
If you check the status,

00:01:43.314 --> 00:01:45.584
you'll see that they aren't yet committed.

00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:47.654
We can commit them in this way,

00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:51.710
and then add this -m to also create our message at the same time.

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:54.000
Now, you can see that we've committed them.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.734
However, they don't exist on this remote repository.

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:01.090
You can make sure to add them to this repository

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.570
that anyone can access by using the git push command.

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.108
Once you've done that, you should end up with a page similar to this

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:13.060
where you'll see each of the files that you've pushed located up here.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.439
It may ask you for your username and

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.069
password related to GitHub to get this final process done.
