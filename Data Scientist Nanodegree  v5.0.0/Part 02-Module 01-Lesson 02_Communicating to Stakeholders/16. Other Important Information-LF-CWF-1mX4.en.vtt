Here are a few other helpful points that are necessary for writing a great post,

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:13.375
but are aimed more at the logistics of creating your post.

00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:19.184
First, being short and sweet wherever possible will increase the number of viewers.

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:23.964
Try to limit your posts between one to two pages or 200 to 500 words,

00:00:23.964 --> 00:00:25.769
not including the images.

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.500
Second, create an outline.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.960
In the case of the post you're making for this project,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.710
your questions will serve as a great outline.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.255
I imagine an outline for my post as introduction,

00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:39.469
takeaway one, takeaway two,

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.284
takeaway three, and then a conclusion.

00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:45.319
This outline will make sure that everything I write is

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.020
tied to one of these points and that I don't get too far off track.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.520
Finally, reviewing your work is important.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.040
The more you and others can review the work the better it will become,

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.545
not only will you catch small mistakes,

00:00:59.545 --> 00:01:02.539
but you'll also be able to make sure that you're writing in a way

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.689
that's relatable and easy to understand for your readers.

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.140
This part is imperative for the successful posts,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.775
but don't be afraid to post

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:14.630
unfinished thoughts or questions and challenges that you're still pondering.

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:17.329
Sometimes the feedback process can help

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.599
spark new ideas that you otherwise wouldn't have looked into.
