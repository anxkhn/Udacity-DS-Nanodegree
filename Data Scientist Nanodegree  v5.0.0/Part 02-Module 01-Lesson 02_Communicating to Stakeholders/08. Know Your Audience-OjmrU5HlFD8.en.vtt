00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.189
Before you can create a post,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.109
you need to think about who your audience is.

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.174
Your post is for them.

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:16.870
You need to write in a way that lets your audience relate to the topic of your post.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.289
If your audience is a bunch of programmers and data scientists,

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.730
it can be useful to write in a way that expresses the technical details of your work.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.199
Talk about the edge cases and the difficulties of the data you are working with.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.439
Share your thought process and working through these difficulties.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.474
It is important to help them understand why you chose certain strategies.

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:38.895
If you came up with a creative solution,

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:43.025
help your audience understand why you think it's better than existing solutions.

00:00:43.024 --> 00:00:44.384
On the other hand,

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:47.719
if your audience's general and abroad group,

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.214
it's important that your post is relatable for these individuals.

00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:55.790
You should discuss your questions of interests and your results for each question.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.064
Discuss the interesting findings in a way that anyone can relate to.

00:01:00.064 --> 00:01:04.569
It's easy to forget how far someone might be from the project you are working on,

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.724
while you're head has been immersed and the context for awhile,

00:01:07.724 --> 00:01:10.449
most of your audience's heads have not.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.700
Try asking someone unfamiliar with your work to read

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.659
through it and then ask them what they took away from it.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.944
If the points they took away match your goals for the post,

00:01:19.944 --> 00:01:21.919
this can ensure that you're writing in a way

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.719
that emphasizes your main points to the reader.
