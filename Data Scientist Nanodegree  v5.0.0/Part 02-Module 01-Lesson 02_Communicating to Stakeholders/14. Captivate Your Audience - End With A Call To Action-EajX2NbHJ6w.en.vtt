Finally, in writing your post,

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.980
you need to provide an ending that brings home your key takeaways for the reader

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.975
and leaves them with a positive feeling

00:00:13.974 --> 00:00:16.384
about the time they just spent reading your article.

00:00:16.385 --> 00:00:19.030
It's often good to finish by reiterating

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.255
the main points or leaving them with a call to action.

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:24.769
For example, at the end of my post,

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.629
I intend to reiterate the findings of my analysis by discussing the way

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:32.704
that people broke into the field and the different statistics I found to be true.

00:00:32.704 --> 00:00:34.884
I also put out a call to action.

00:00:34.884 --> 00:00:36.839
How will you break into the field?

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.670
This recap and call to action is

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.560
an extremely effective method for boosting user engagement with your posts.
