Once you have your project on GitHub,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.205
it's time to present your findings to the world.

00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:15.580
One of the most popular networks for sharing anything and everything, is Medium.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.125
This wonderful platform will be your friend

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:20.929
for this project as a means to share your findings.

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.370
Below, you can find a link to a post on how to get started with Medium.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.195
As an introverted person,

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:28.980
worried about what others will think,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.995
I can relate to being afraid to post your work to the world.

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:33.679
But it's a way to stand out,

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.320
this is especially true if you're trying to break

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.259
into a new field or are freshly out of school.

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:43.854
The best way to show someone you can do a job is to show them what you've done,

00:00:43.854 --> 00:00:48.359
and Medium is a great spot to share your work as a data scientist.
