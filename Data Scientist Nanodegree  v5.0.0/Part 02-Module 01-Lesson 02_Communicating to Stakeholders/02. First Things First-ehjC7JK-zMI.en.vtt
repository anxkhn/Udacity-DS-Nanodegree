00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.695
Before you write up a blog post,

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:09.900
it's useful to put your code and

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.054
technical work in a place where it can be accessed by others.

00:00:13.054 --> 00:00:16.925
That place for us, and for many developers is GitHub.

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:19.880
Each of the projects you add to GitHub should have

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:23.210
a ReadMe file that describes the installations needed,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.330
the motivations for your project,

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.994
the files for your project,

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:29.359
and how a user should interact with them,

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.060
and any licensing authors and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.160
other acknowledgments necessary should another user decide to use your code elsewhere.

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:40.250
Potential employers and other programmers and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.590
the community will look to understand your project by looking at your ReadMe.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.765
Clear communication in your ReadMe,

00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:50.539
is therefore beneficial to you and to the community.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.519
Let's take a look at some examples.
