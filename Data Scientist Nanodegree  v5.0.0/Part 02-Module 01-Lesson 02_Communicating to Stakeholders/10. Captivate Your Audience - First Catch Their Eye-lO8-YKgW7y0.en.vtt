00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.660
No matter how awesome your post is if you do not get people to your page,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.120
no one will know.

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.144
Therefore, you need to hook your reader at first glance.

00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:20.050
With Medium, the first thing your reader will see is your article title and an image.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.394
The image you choose is very important.

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:26.820
Study after study shows that to increase engagement,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.359
you must have a compelling image to first grab your reader.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.969
You should think of your intro to your audience as

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.250
a captivating image first and a supporting title second.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.234
For my post, I considered using a number of different images and corresponding titles.

00:00:42.234 --> 00:00:46.923
Then, I sent them out to some colleagues and friends to vote on the most captivating.

00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:49.295
Though this isn't totally scientific,

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:54.109
it is better than just my one opinion when I can leverage a larger audience.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.689
Again, think of a captivating image related to your post,

00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:00.159
and then find a title to match.
