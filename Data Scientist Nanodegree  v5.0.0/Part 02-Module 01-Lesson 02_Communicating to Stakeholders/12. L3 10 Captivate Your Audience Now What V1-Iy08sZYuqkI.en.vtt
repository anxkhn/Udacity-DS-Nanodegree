00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.805
Once you have your reader on your page,

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:04.294
you need to connect with them,

00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:07.290
and remind them why they care about the information you're providing.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.929
You have approximately two sentences and

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.349
your first image to captivate your reader enough to stay.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.219
A useful tactic is giving a personal story about yourself,

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:19.269
that is also relatable to them.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.994
Or asking questions you have a feeling your audiences also ask themselves.

00:00:23.995 --> 00:00:25.940
Another method is to tie in

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.525
current events that are at the top of your audience member's minds.

00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:32.364
Creating content that is relevant to your audience,

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.725
is key to keeping them on your page.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:37.550
Your content throughout the page should be broken

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:40.339
up into approximately three lines per idea,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.990
with no more than five lines per idea.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.469
Staring at large amounts of texts clumped together without visuals and whitespace,

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.284
is exhausting for a reader.

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:52.689
Keep your sentences short and concise,

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:55.119
and your ideas crisp and clear.
