00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.774
The second big category in machine learning is unsupervised algorithms,

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.250
where we don't have any labeled data points,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.515
we typically try to find clusters based on how similar records are to one another.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.649
The Spark ML API includes K-means,

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:24.989
Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithms.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.529
In real life, problems don't necessarily fit strictly

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.964
in either the supervised or unsupervised category.

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:34.709
So there has been a lot of development on techniques

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:37.200
that implement hybrid approaches.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.135
Spark at this point, has limited support for semi-supervised learning.

00:00:42.134 --> 00:00:45.890
As I mentioned earlier, Spark primary supports algorithms

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.740
that scale linearly with the number of records.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.710
So if you need to use more expensive algorithms

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.364
such as connectivity based clustering,

00:00:54.363 --> 00:00:59.059
which typically scarce quadratic or even cubic with the number of records,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.890
you need to implement your own methods

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.299
or consider using some other framework.
