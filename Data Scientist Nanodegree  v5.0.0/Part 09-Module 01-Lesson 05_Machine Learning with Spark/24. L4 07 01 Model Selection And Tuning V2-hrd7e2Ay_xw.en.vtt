00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.820
So far, we have covered how to prepare

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.970
features and train different machine learning models.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.390
In practice, we often need to explore both

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.289
the number of algorithms as well as their parameter combinations.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.570
Spark allows Hyperparameter tuning through both a single train validation split,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.435
as well as through k-fold cross-validation.

00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:29.109
We can tune a single estimator or whole pipeline.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.185
We just need to specify two additional objects.

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:35.664
The first is the Parameter Grid we would like to explore.

00:00:35.664 --> 00:00:38.454
The second is the Evaluator.

00:00:38.454 --> 00:00:41.573
The Evaluator as its name suggests,

00:00:41.573 --> 00:00:46.149
defines the metric we were used to evaluate the results on the test set.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.609
It's worth noting that after identifying

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.895
the best parameter combination using the built-in cross validation methods,

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:58.180
Spark fix the estimator using this best parameter map and the entire dataset.

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.500
Up until Version 2.3, the models corresponding to different points on

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.004
the perimeter grid are trained sequentially,

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:07.689
which might be inefficient even when for the training for

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.870
a single model is distributed across the cluster.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.395
Starting from version 2.3,

00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:16.435
models can be trained and evaluated in parallel.

00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:19.549
This way better utilizing the available resources.

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.429
Serial training will still be the default configuration at least initially,

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.210
but this behavior now can be changed through the parallelism parameter.
