00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.810
Welcome to the last lesson of this course.

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:10.829
We will spend this whole lesson learning about machine learning in Spark.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.019
We have worked too many examples of

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.679
different components of a typical machine learning pipeline including;

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.504
feature creation, model training, and hyper-parameter tuning.

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:24.494
We've covered Spark's capabilities and its limitations.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:26.370
By completing this lesson,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.115
you will be able to scale up your machine learning tasks,

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:31.629
and train models at scale.
