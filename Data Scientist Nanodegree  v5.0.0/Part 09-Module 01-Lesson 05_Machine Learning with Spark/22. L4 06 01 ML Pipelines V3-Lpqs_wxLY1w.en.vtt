00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:08.789
Spark ML Pipeline API was inspired by scikit-learn,

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:10.889
and just like scikit-learn, it allows

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.839
combining several data processing

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.050
and other training steps into a single workflow.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.315
Pipelines have two main components, Transformers and Estimators.

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:26.789
The transformer is an algorithm that transforms one data frame to another.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.660
There are two common places that transformers are used.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.579
The first is in feature transformations,

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.320
like you saw earlier, we're changing categorical

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.200
or text variables to numeric columns.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.000
The second is making predictions for supervised learning models by

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.844
transforming your features using a model into the predicted outcomes.

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:52.609
Estimators, on the other hand, fit algorithm parameters

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.575
on a dataframe to create a transformer.

00:00:55.575 --> 00:01:03.000
A pipeline chains multiple transformers and estimators together to pacify an MR workflow.
