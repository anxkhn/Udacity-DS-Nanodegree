00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.660
Congratulations. You have made it through.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.185
In this lesson, we have learned a lot about Sparks ML API.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:13.425
You have learned how to calculate and transform features,

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:16.859
how to train Machine Learning Models supported in the API,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.519
how to build pipelines from Transformers and Estimators,

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.939
and how to select the optimal model for your problem.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.800
This foundation will help you to train ML models on big data instead of

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.020
constraining yourself to the data sets that can fit on a single machine. Good job.
