00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.919
In the previous lessons, we went through examples

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.910
of how you can clean your dataset and handle missing values.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.515
Before we can start feeding our features into any machine learning algorithm,

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:20.640
we need to make sure that our input is in the correct format.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.880
Just as most other machine learning libraries,

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:26.460
Spark cannot expects numeric input values.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.929
So if you are dealing with categorical variables or free-form text,

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.344
we need to transform our features first.

00:00:33.344 --> 00:00:36.390
Even for numeric data, we might need to risk here

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.384
that particular feature to enhance certain algorithms performance.

00:00:41.384 --> 00:00:45.349
So let's start with scanning numeric features.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.115
Our raw features might be on a very different scales.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:53.255
Think for example, about how many songs a user listened to

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:58.250
in the past hour versus how many days ago they started using our service?

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.609
If you use a classifier that calculates the distance

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.954
between two data points based on Euclidean distance,

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:08.870
the feature with divided strange may dominate the result.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.844
This is why we need to normalize our features to the same range

00:01:12.844 --> 00:01:17.734
typically in between zero and one or minus one and one.

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:22.039
Spark supports many different scaling approaches including

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.485
normalizer, StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, and MaxAbsScaler,

00:01:28.484 --> 00:01:31.019
which you can find links to below.

00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:34.228
Spark also supports String Indexer,

00:01:34.228 --> 00:01:39.939
Index to String, and Vector Indexer which you can find links to below.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.269
We will also do some work on text processing later in this lesson.
