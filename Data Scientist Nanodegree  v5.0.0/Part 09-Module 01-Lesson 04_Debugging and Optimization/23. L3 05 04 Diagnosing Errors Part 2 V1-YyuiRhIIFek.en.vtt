00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.845
Next, let's focus on some core metrics for

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:11.279
understanding the current state of the Sparkify business.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.250
These numbers would be so important to your entire team.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.410
They'd be displayed on dashboards throughout

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.260
your company and every team would check them regularly.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.750
In fact, your CEO would probably check

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.780
them first thing every morning when she eats her breakfast.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.484
The first key metric is monthly active users.

00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:33.179
The number of unique users who listened to at least one song in the past month.

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:36.064
Rather than looking at the total number of accounts,

00:00:36.064 --> 00:00:37.789
this number gives you a better sense of

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.439
how many people are using your site on a regular basis.

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:46.774
We'll also calculate the daily active users for each day in the past month.

00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:51.454
Both the total number and the percentage of the monthly active users.

00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:56.015
The daily actives help your team understand how engaged your users are.

00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:58.609
Do they casually use Sparkify every now and

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.299
then or does your service keep them coming back every day?

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.640
We'll also calculate the total number of

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.025
paid and unpaid users as well as the total ads served in the past month.

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:14.580
These metrics tied directly to the monthly revenue that Sparkify earns.
