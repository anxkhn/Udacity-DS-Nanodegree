00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:07.649
Next, you'll tackle a common approach for

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.040
understanding how your users interact with your service over time.

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:12.839
Cohort analysis.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.019
The main idea of cohort analysis is that someone who joins

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.320
Sparkify a year ago probably behaves differently than a brand new user.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.949
So, you should analyze them in separate groups which we'll call cohorts.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.140
For example, all the users who joined Sparkify in January 2018 will be one cohort.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.179
We'll compare their activity to

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:37.125
previous cohorts like the users who joined in December 2017,

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:39.869
November 2017, and so on.

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:43.969
For each cohort, we'll calculate two metrics: the percentage

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.600
of users who upgrade to paid accounts within their first three months,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.840
and the percentage who cancel within three months.
