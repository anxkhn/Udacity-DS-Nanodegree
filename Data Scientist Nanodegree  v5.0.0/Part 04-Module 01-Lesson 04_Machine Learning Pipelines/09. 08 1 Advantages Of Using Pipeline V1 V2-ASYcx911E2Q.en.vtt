00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.080
In the last video,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.650
you saw how Scikit-learn's pipeline utility allows

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.685
you to chain a sequence of machine learning steps into one estimator.

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:17.274
This has massive advantages.

00:00:17.274 --> 00:00:21.964
First of all, it adds simplicity and convenience to your workflow.

00:00:21.964 --> 00:00:26.464
Chaining all of your steps into one estimator allows you to fit

00:00:26.464 --> 00:00:31.335
and predict on all steps of your sequence automatically with one call.

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:34.560
Not only does this make your code more concise,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.125
it also makes your workflow much easier to understand and modify.

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:44.719
Because pipeline automates the intermediate steps required to execute each step,

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.609
it reduces the mental burden of having to keep track of all your data transformations.

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.179
Without pipeline, your model can easily turn into

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.878
messy spaghetti code from all the adjustments

00:00:55.878 --> 00:00:59.294
and experimentation required to improve your model.

00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:05.275
Using pipeline may require some extra work at the beginning of your modeling process,

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:08.234
but it prevents a lot of headaches later on.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:12.215
It handles those smaller steps for you so you can focus

00:01:12.215 --> 00:01:17.010
on implementing higher-level changes swiftly and efficiently.
