00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
Now that you've cleaned and tokenized the text data,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.224
it's time to complete the rest of your Machine Learning workflow.

00:00:07.224 --> 00:00:11.669
In the next page, you'll find a workspace containing this notebook.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.535
The first three cells contain work from the previous section,

00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:19.519
and here is where you'll complete your Machine Learning workflow.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.519
This lesson will teach you how to do this more effectively using pipelines.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:30.414
However, it's important that you first build this out the normal way, without pipelines.

00:00:30.414 --> 00:00:34.765
Follow the steps here to build and test your classifier.

00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:39.329
Once you're finished, refactor these steps into these two functions.
