00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
In this lesson, we'll learn about automating our machine-learning workflows with

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.474
pipelines using this dataset on corporate messaging as a case study.

00:00:10.474 --> 00:00:14.994
This is one of the free datasets provided on the figure-eight platform.

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:19.469
Each row contains information about a social media post from

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:24.794
different corporations and contains a column for the category of the post.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:28.710
If we look at the value counts for this category column,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.329
we can see that each post is classified as information,

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.429
action, dialogue or exclude.

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:37.740
If we look back on the figure-eight site,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.635
we can find a description of each category.

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:44.929
Information, objective statements about the company or its activities,

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.530
dialogue like replies to users or

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.899
action such as messages that ask for votes or ask users to click on links.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.670
Information seems to be the most common category by far followed by

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.875
action and then dialogue and exclude seems to be a miscellaneous column.

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:07.625
Also notice that we have a category confidence column.

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:11.269
Since we're only interested in rows classified into one

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:15.058
of these top three categories with full confidence,

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:18.500
we're going to narrow down to rows with a confidence of

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.668
one and category that is not exclude.

00:01:22.668 --> 00:01:25.170
Awesome. This is what we have left.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.460
Now, let's isolate the columns to be used as

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:33.189
features and labels in this classifier and convert them to NumPy arrays.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.384
Here, those would be the text column and the category column.

00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:41.885
Here's the first row of text data and the category for that first row.

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:45.370
To repeat the transformations made on this dataset,

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.215
here are steps in a nice,

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:51.064
low data function that we'll use for the rest of our lesson.

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:58.069
Let's try it out. Now our dataset has 2,403 rows of corporate messaging data.
