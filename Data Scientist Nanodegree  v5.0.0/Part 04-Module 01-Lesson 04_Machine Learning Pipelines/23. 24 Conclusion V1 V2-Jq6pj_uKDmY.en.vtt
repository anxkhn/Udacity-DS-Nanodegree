00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.290
Yeah. You just finished a lesson,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.539
where you used pipelines, feature unions,

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.809
and grid search to optimize your machine learning workflows,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.524
and you completed a case study that built an entire pipeline for a dataset.

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:23.009
This is a great skill to know when creating models for data science work.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.490
I encourage you to keep investing the short time in

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.104
the beginning of your modeling process to implement pipelines.

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:32.160
Your code will be cleaner,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.539
and you'll be able to automate the training and cross-validation of your models.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.439
Congratulations again on completing this lesson.
