00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.205
As mentioned earlier in the lesson,

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:10.919
a powerful benefit to using pipeline is

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.714
the ability to perform a grid search on your entire workflow.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:19.699
Most machine learning algorithms have a set of parameters that need tuning.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.619
Grid search is a tool that allows you to define

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.339
a grid of parameters or a set of values to check.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:32.465
Your computer automates the process of trying out all possible combination of values.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:36.645
Grid search scores each combination with cross-validation,

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:39.740
and uses the cross-validation score to

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.960
determine the parameters that produce the most optimal model.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.625
Running grid search on your pipeline allows you to try many parameter values

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:55.744
thoroughly and conveniently for both your data transformations and estimators.

00:00:55.744 --> 00:01:00.834
Again, although you can run grid search on just a single classifier,

00:01:00.835 --> 00:01:03.935
running it on your whole pipeline helps you test

00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:08.325
multiple parameter combinations across your entire workflow.

00:01:08.325 --> 00:01:13.609
This accounts for interactions among parameters not just in your model,

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.174
but data preparation steps as well.

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:18.799
Let's see how this works.
