00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.195
Welcome to this lesson on machine learning pipelines.

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:13.660
Previously, you built ETL pipelines to get your data ready.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.070
In this lesson, you will build pipelines to automate

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.679
your machine learning workflows that train on this data.

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:25.074
You will learn about the advantages of using machine learning pipelines,

00:00:25.074 --> 00:00:29.614
practice using Scikit-learn's Pipeline and Feature Union classes,

00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:32.649
grid search over your entire workflow,

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.629
and walk through a case study,

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.670
building a full pipeline for data set. Let's get started.
