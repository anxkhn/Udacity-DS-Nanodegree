00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.304
There are a couple of other advantages to using pipeline.

00:00:09.304 --> 00:00:12.629
Arguably, the most important is the ability to

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.179
optimize your entire workflow with grid search.

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.679
Grid search is a method that automates the process of

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.545
testing different values to find the combination of parameters,

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:26.400
the result in the highest performing model.

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.109
We will dive into this deeper later in the lesson.

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.664
Although grid search can be run on a single classifier to tune its parameters,

00:00:35.664 --> 00:00:39.409
varying this on your full pipeline allows you to tune

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.259
the parameters in your data preparation and model,

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:48.625
which accounts for any interactions among the steps that may affect the final score.

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:52.280
Without grid search, tuning these parameters can be

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.325
painfully slow, incomplete, and messy.

00:00:56.325 --> 00:01:01.520
The last advantage of pipelining we'll talk about is that it helps prevent

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.430
the easy mistake of leaking knowledge from

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.275
test or validation data into your training process.

00:01:08.275 --> 00:01:13.130
Using pipeline, all transformations for data preparation and

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:18.424
feature extractions occur within each fold of the cross-validation process.

00:01:18.424 --> 00:01:20.834
This prevents common mistakes,

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:25.559
where you would allow your training process to be influenced by your test data.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.620
For example, if you use

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.920
the entire training dataset to normalize or extract features from your data.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.975
This probably sounds confusing now,

00:01:35.974 --> 00:01:41.159
but it'll be much clearer when you see this in code in the next video.
