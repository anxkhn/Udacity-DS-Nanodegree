In this project, you'll apply these skills to analyze disaster data from [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/) to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.\n\nIn the Project Workspace, you'll find a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. You will be creating a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.\n\nYour project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data. This project will show off your software skills, including your ability to create basic data pipelines and write clean, organized code!\n\nBelow are a few screenshots of the web app.",

ML Pipeline\nIn a Python script, `train_classifier.py`, write a machine learning pipeline that:\n* Loads data from the SQLite database\n* Splits the dataset into training and test sets\n* Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline\n* Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV\n* Outputs results on the test set\n* Exports the final model as a pickle file\n\n### 3. Flask Web App\n\nWe are providing much of the flask web app for you, but feel free to add extra features depending on your knowledge of flask, html, css and javascript. For this part, you'll need to:\n * Modify file paths for database and model as needed\n * Add data visualizations using Plotly in the web app. One example is provided for  you\n\n### Github and Code Quality\nYour project will also be graded based on the following:\n- Use of Git and Github\n- Strong documentation\n- Clean and modular code\n\nFollow the [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1565/view) when you work on your project to assure you meet all of the necessary criteria for developing the pipelines and web app.",

The Jupyter notebook is not required for submission, but highly recommended to complete before getting started on the Python script.\n\n### Project Workspace - ETL\nThe first part of your data pipeline is the Extract, Transform, and Load process. Here, you will read the dataset, clean the data, and then store it in a SQLite database. We expect you to do the data cleaning with pandas. To load the data into an SQLite database, you can use the pandas dataframe `.to_sql()` method, which you can use with an SQLAlchemy engine.\n\nFeel free to do some exploratory data analysis in order to figure out how you want to clean the data set. Though you do not need to submit this exploratory data analysis as part of your project, you'll need to include your cleaning code in the final ETL script, `process_data.py`.\n\n### Project Workspace - Machine Learning Pipeline\nFor the machine learning portion, you will split the data into a training set and a test set. Then, you will create a machine learning pipeline that uses NLTK, as well as scikit-learn's Pipeline and GridSearchCV to output a final model that uses the `message` column to predict classifications for 36 categories (multi-output classification). Finally, you will export your model to a pickle file. After completing the notebook, you'll need to include your final machine learning code in `train_classifier.py`.",
