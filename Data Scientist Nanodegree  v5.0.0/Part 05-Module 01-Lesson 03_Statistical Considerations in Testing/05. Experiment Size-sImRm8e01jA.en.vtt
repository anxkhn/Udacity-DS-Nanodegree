00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.650
Practical significance is useful not only

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.225
for making a decision at the end of the experiment,

00:00:10.224 --> 00:00:13.844
but also for actually setting up the experiment scope.

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:17.730
Let's consider an AB test where we want to see if changing

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.109
the layout of a homepage brings more visitors to a digital storefront.

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.850
The current click-through rate is 10 percent and the practical significance boundary we

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.795
want to see what the new layout is a twopercent absolute increase to 12 percent.

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:34.664
How many data points do we need to record in

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:37.914
order to reliably detect that kind of change?

00:00:37.914 --> 00:00:41.945
The concept you should recall here is statistical power.

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:45.590
Power is the probability that a hypothesis test will

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.795
actually detect a particular true mean as different from the null.

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:52.429
The curves on these two plots represent

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.950
the expected distribution of the difference in sample

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.590
means given 1,000 observations in each of the control group and experimental group.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.545
The top curve gives the distribution of differences

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:06.079
if there was no effect on the new layout,

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.855
and the bottom curve gives the distribution of differences

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:12.950
assuming our desired two percent increase in click-through rate.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.040
On the top curve, a vertical line indicates

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.965
the critical value for a type one error rate of five percent.

00:01:19.965 --> 00:01:23.900
Matching this critical value from the null hypothesis curve down to

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.290
the desired alternative hypothesis curve allows us to see

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.715
the power on the right of the line and the type two error rate on the left.

00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:34.655
Increasing the number of data points will narrow

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:37.885
both curves, increasing statistical power.

00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:40.555
If we want a power of 0.8,

00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:43.920
or in other words, an 80 percent chance of rejecting the null,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.465
assuming a 12 percent true click-through rate,

00:01:46.465 --> 00:01:49.420
then we need at least 2,863

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.829
observations in each of our control group and experimental group.

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.875
We can then refer to our website's daily traffic

00:01:56.875 --> 00:02:00.034
to figure out about how long we should run the experiment.

00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:03.039
If we have about 500 visitors per day,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.130
then this means that we should run the experiment for about 12 days.

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:08.740
Perhaps rounding up to a full two weeks to try and

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.920
reduce potential effects of weekly cycles.

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:15.375
After collecting data for this predetermined time period,

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:20.275
we can then analyze the data to see the effectiveness of the website layout change.

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:24.020
Checking for the expected experiment length is important since you

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.755
want to be able to act on your findings while they're still relevant.

00:02:27.754 --> 00:02:31.490
If you find that the required time for a design is too long,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.975
then you might need to change statistical parameters.

00:02:33.974 --> 00:02:37.519
This might meet increasing the practical significance boundary or

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.165
focusing your design into different metrics or populations.

00:02:41.164 --> 00:02:46.560
This will reduce variability in order to shorten the study to a more reasonable length.
