00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:07.359
We assumed two independent metrics,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.480
each with a five per cent chance of a type one error.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.304
This means that under the null hypothesis,

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:16.170
there is a 90.25 percent chance that

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.145
both metric sample means aren't statistically significant and a 9.75 percent chance,

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:24.914
that one or both make a type one error.

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:28.724
We'd be making almost twice our desired number of type one errors

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:32.939
if we made a decision based on just seeing one significant metric.

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:35.554
This example is highly simplified,

00:00:35.554 --> 00:00:37.965
but it illustrates a potential problem with making

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:41.390
too many errors if we make multiple comparisons.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.530
To overcome this, we need to perform a correction on the error rate for

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.245
each test to keep the overall error rate below some threshold.

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:54.349
The simplest of these corrections is the Bonferroni correction,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.605
which divides the overall error rate by the number of test to be performed.

00:00:58.604 --> 00:01:03.515
For our example, this means dividing 0.05 by two.

00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:08.495
Each of the individual tests will be run at a 2.5 percent significance level.

00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:11.120
Assuming independence between tests,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.120
this results in an overall error rate of just under five percent.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.590
Different corrections are possible and can depend on the number of

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.320
evaluation metrics you have and the desired pattern of results.
