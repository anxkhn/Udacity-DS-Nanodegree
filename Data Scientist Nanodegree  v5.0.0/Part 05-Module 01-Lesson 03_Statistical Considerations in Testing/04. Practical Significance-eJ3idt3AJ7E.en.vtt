00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:07.710
Let's say you've just finished running an experiment,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.750
where you send out a promotional coupon to

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.324
a mailing list in order to see if it drives up sales in your online store.

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:16.800
Going through the statistical analysis,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.875
you find that there is a statistically significant effect.

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:22.710
People who received the coupon were five percent more

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.925
likely to make purchases than those that did not.

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:30.000
Does this mean that we should send out the coupon on a broader scale?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.940
Not necessarily.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.120
If the cost of sending out the coupon and reduced revenue

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:38.390
from the coupon outweigh the revenue that was gained without it,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.634
then it doesn't make sense to use the coupon on a broad scale.

00:00:41.634 --> 00:00:46.729
This is an example of the importance of considering practical significance.

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.869
Practical significance refers to the level of effect that you want to see in

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:53.419
your experiment in order for it to make sense

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.715
for your manipulations to actually be implemented.

00:00:56.715 --> 00:00:59.035
As suggested by the example,

00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:02.244
simply because your experiment is statistically significant,

00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:04.789
does not necessarily mean that it's also

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.240
practically significant and worth following through.
