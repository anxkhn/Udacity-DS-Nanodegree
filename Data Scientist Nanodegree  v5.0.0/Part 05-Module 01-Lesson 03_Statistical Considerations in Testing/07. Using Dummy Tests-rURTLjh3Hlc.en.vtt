00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:08.579
Even though the focus of this part of the course is on designing

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.080
experiments to measure the effect of changes and manipulations,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.280
it's worth noting that it's useful to conduct dummy tests in certain cases.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.554
A dummy test is one that implements no changes

00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:23.239
and just compares two equivalent groups with one another.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.434
For the AB testing paradigm,

00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:28.849
a dummy test is also called an AA test.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.420
If a dummy test is a comparison between equivalent groups,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.524
then why would we want to do this?

00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:36.780
There are two major reasons.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.740
First of all you can use a dummy test to make

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.844
sure that your experiment is working as expected.

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:47.129
You can check that each of your groups is receiving an equal number of participants,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.120
and that the outcomes of your invariant and evaluation

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:54.699
metrics both conform to the expectation of seeing no change.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.920
If any of these things don't come out as expected,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.120
then you should check for problems such as in the engineering side of the design.

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.459
It's important to note that there's always the chance of making a type one error.

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:11.318
So, a statistical significance on a single metric may not necessarily be a deal breaker,

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.290
just something to investigate.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.950
The second big reason why you might want to run a dummy test is if you need to collect

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.909
information about the behavior of your metrics in order to scope out the full design.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.420
If you don't have reliable historic data

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.920
to predict the distribution of the outcome metrics,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.415
a dummy test can give you some insight into

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:34.585
how much variability and experimental result with no effect would look like.

00:01:34.584 --> 00:01:38.559
Baseline rates obtained from a dummy test can also help out in

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.750
figuring out how large an experiment needs to be and how long it needs to run.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.049
Of course, a dummy test is not without its downsides.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.280
Time spent running a dummy test is time that you're not using to run your actual test.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.590
Since timeliness of results is an important virtue of experiment design,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.780
running a dummy test may not be reasonable

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.915
except for companies with the largest user basis.

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:05.030
It might be the case that you'll need to go

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.040
ahead with the experiment without a dummy test for

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.840
verification and just keep an eye out for any major deviations from your expectations.
