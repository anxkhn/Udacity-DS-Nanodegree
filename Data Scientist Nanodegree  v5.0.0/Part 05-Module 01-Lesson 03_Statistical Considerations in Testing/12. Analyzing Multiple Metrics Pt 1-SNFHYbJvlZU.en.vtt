00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.769
If you have multiple evaluation metrics to track in your experiment,

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.344
then you should be careful to specify the criteria for calling your experiment a success,

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:16.769
so that you don't make excessive errors in your judgment.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.875
For example, let's take this experiment

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:22.925
with an online store front with two evaluation metrics.

00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:24.830
The probability of adding a product to

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.409
the cart and the probability of actually completing checkout.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.964
Although, these measures are correlated,

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:34.579
we'll simplify the example by assuming that they're independent.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.414
Let's say that we call the experiment a success

00:00:37.414 --> 00:00:40.504
if either metric is statistically significant.

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:43.185
At a five percent type one error rate,

00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:46.870
what is the probability that we falsely called the experiment is success,

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:50.519
assuming that there is no actual effect of our changes?
