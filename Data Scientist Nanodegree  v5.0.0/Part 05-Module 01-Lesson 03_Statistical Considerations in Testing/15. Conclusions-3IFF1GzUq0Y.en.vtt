00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.860
Great work. In this lesson,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.620
you've learned about a number of statistical techniques that can be

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.079
used to set up and analyze your studies and experiments.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.530
You learned about practical significance and

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.060
how it differs from statistical significance.

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:24.494
You used practical significance to make decisions about experiment size and length.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:28.450
You learned about the potential usefulness of dummy tests.

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.699
Then you learned about a couple of warning points in analysis,

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.339
making a decision based on multiple metrics,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.805
and making decisions based on early peaks at the results.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.310
At this point, you've learned about

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.615
both conceptual and statistical principles to use in your experiments and studies.

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:48.859
I know that a lot of the principles and guidelines presented

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.789
in these lessons can be difficult to really comprehend,

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.414
until you've gotten some practice working with them.

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:55.905
In the next lesson,

00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:59.840
you'll get some case study experience to practice what you've learned.
