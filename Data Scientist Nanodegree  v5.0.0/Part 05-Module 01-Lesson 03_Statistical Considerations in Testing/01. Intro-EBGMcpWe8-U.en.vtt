00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.980
You might think that the importance of statistics in

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.414
experiment design lies only in analyzing the results of an experiment.

00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:16.419
Set up the design following the principles established in the previous lesson,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.140
collect some data, and then use statistics to analyze the data.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.519
Well, there's actually more importance for statistics in

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.364
your experimental design rather than just coming in at the end.

00:00:27.364 --> 00:00:32.655
For example, that point about collecting some data seems a bit vague.

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:35.340
How much data will you need before you can judge

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.045
your experiment's success on solid grounds?

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:43.250
Do I need a thousand data points, 10,000, or 100,000.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.759
Factors like the size of the effect that you want to see can

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:50.089
have a major effect on how much data you need to collect,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.835
and how long it will take before you get your results.

00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:57.859
This lesson will help you see how statistical techniques can

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.894
be used to make solid decisions in your experimental designs.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.040
In the first part of this lesson,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.605
you'll learn about how statistical techniques can help you

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:10.290
answer questions related to setting up an experiment.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.980
Then, in the second part of the lesson,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.560
you'll learn about some tricky pitfalls that can come as

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.000
a part of enlightened outcomes of an experiment.
