00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.975
While an experiment is running,

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:11.099
you'll probably be tempted at some point to take a peek at how it's going.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.820
If you see from that peak that the experiment is going well,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.204
you might then be tempted to just end the experiment

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:20.599
early and deploy the tested changes right away.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.670
It's important to resist these temptations since

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.060
this peaking will increase your overall error rate.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:31.585
Take for example, a case where you analyze the data in two places,

00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:33.250
once at the halfway point,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.840
and once at the end of the scheduled runtime.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.535
Let's run a bunch of simulations for outcomes under the null hypothesis.

00:00:40.534 --> 00:00:44.814
If we used a five percent significance level at each checkpoint,

00:00:44.814 --> 00:00:47.659
then it's not too surprising that about five percent of

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.609
the simulations get marked as statistically significant at each one.

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.884
That's a natural outcome of our type one error rate.

00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:57.920
However, less than two percent of all the tests are

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.770
statistically significant at both the halfway point,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.240
and at the end.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.390
Most of the simulations that were statistically significant at

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.754
the halfway point would end up non-significant at the end.

00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:12.739
If we decided to stop the experiment early

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.949
from seeing a significant difference at the halfway point,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.685
then we would end up with an overall error rate around 8.6 percent, not five percent.

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:25.945
That's not to say that we can't do a peek ahead to make an early decision,

00:01:25.944 --> 00:01:28.654
we just need to account for it in our design.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.140
If you're willing to wait,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.909
there is some additional math for it,

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.104
you can find formulas and other resources to help you come up with

00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:40.400
early stopping rules without compromising the integrity of your experimental design.
