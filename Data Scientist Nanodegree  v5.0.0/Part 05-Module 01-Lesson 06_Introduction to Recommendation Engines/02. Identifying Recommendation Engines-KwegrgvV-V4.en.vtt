This is one way to get recommendations but recommendations are everywhere nowadays.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.535
Some recommendations are based on location,

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:20.990
like recommendations made on dating apps

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.509
while others are just a running list of top items,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.385
like this list of items on Walmart's website,

00:00:27.385 --> 00:00:30.860
and others are based on previous preferences like

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.875
these movies and TV shows picked specifically for Tom.

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:38.310
There are lots of ways in which recommendations are made,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.840
and for certain scenarios,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.200
some recommendations are better than others.
