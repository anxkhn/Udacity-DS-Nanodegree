Let's take the first step towards providing more personalized recommendations.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.455
Consider Sam here.

00:00:11.455 --> 00:00:13.650
Same has seen Armageddon,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.745
Independence Day, and Arrival. Then there's Jesse.

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:22.865
Jesse has also seen these movies but has also watched Interstellar.

00:00:22.864 --> 00:00:26.794
Due to the overlapping movies watch between Sam and Jessie,

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:30.225
it follows that Sam might also like Interstellar.

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:32.730
In recommendations of this nature,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:37.049
it makes sense to find users who've watched the same movies and

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:42.669
recommend new movies based on what one of those users has seen that the other hasn't.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.590
Finding these types of relationships from

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.760
user-item interactions is known as collaborative filtering.
