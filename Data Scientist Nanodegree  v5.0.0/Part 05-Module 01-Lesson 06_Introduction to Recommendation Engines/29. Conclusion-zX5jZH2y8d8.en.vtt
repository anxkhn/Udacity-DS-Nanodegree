00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.349
In this lesson, we'll introduce to

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:10.679
the three main methods used to create recommedation engines,

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.719
and you got a glimpse at building these recommendations using the MovieTweetings data.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.265
You then saw some of the different rating scales you might use from click or not,

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:21.490
to like or dislike,

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.375
to more granular scales.

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:26.980
Finally, we've looked at some of the goals recommenders play in

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.649
meeting business needs that assists with the goal of driving revenue.

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.164
In the next lesson,

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:34.570
we'll look at collaborative filtering methods that use

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.570
machine learning to make recommendations as well

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.715
as some other difficult questions to answer

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:43.560
like how do we measure how good our recommendations even are?
