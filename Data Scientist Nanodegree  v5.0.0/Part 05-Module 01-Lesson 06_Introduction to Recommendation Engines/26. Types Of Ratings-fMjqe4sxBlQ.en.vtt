00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:06.049
So we've now seen,

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.304
three main types of recommendation engines.

00:00:08.304 --> 00:00:10.519
Knowledge based, collaborative filtering

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.554
recommendations and content-based recommendations.

00:00:13.554 --> 00:00:16.089
We should also discuss the different types of

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:19.184
ratings that we might collect to make recommendations.

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:23.375
In some cases, we only know if a user's interacted with an item.

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:28.335
In many cases, it might be more helpful to know if a user actually liked an item.

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:30.940
There are different scales that we might use to

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.890
measure how much an individual likes an item.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.670
This could be as simple as like or dislike.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.789
You might also retrieve ratings on a spectrum.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.354
One to three, one to five,

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:46.274
one to seven and one to 10 are all common spectrums.

00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:49.310
Depending on the granularity you would like and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.609
whether or not you want a user to allow for a neutral standing,

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.704
you might choose one rating scale over another.

00:00:55.704 --> 00:00:59.210
When you do have the ability to obtain a rating from users,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.820
think about what type of rating would mean the most.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.859
I personally would suggest building

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.864
the simplest scaling that gives you the information you need.

00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:09.084
If you can understand all that you want,

00:01:09.084 --> 00:01:12.039
from just a like or dislike, use that.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.400
If you need something more granular,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.840
consider of having someone be in the middle will hurt your results.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.159
Maybe you want the opportunity for someone to be exactly neutral.

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.829
All of these aspects should be considered in

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.719
helping you determine the scale that you decide to use.
