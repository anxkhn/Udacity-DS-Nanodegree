00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.175
Collaborative filtering methods largely fall in two categories.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:12.695
The first is known as model based collaborative filtering,

00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:16.410
which uses machine learning techniques to make recommendations.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.359
This will be discussed in the next lesson.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.689
The second of these is known as

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.190
neighborhood based collaborative filtering which we'll cover now.

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.009
The name neighborhood is used to suggest that we're

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.445
interested in finding individuals that are closely related to one another.

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:40.954
We saw Jesse and Sam were highly related because they had watched the same movies.

00:00:40.954 --> 00:00:43.920
Therefore, they are closer neighbors than say,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.490
Noah, who has not seen any of these movies.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.789
I like to think of identifying neighborhoods in two possible ways.

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.325
One is measuring similarity and the second is measuring distance.

00:00:57.325 --> 00:01:02.765
You might be thinking these sound like they're the same thing and they are very similar.

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:07.200
Common measures of similarity include Pearson's correlation coefficient,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.890
Spearman's correlation coefficient and Kendall's tau.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.515
Each of these measures takes on a value in the range between negative one and one.

00:01:16.515 --> 00:01:18.954
When using any of these measures,

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:21.034
as values move closer to one,

00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:24.829
this suggests that two individuals are more similar.

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.780
For making recommendations, we want to find users that have the highest values of

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.335
these coefficients and they are most similar and therefore live in closer neighborhoods.

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:42.149
Distance based measures include Euclidian Distance and Manhattan Distance.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.234
Alternative to similarity based metrics,

00:01:45.234 --> 00:01:48.594
we want to find small values of these measures.

00:01:48.594 --> 00:01:53.730
Distance based metrics range from zero to essentially infinity.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.385
The closer these values are to zero,

00:01:56.385 --> 00:01:59.940
the more similar two individuals are to one another.

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.289
Identifying neighborhoods with these metrics means

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.215
finding individuals who are closer to zero.

00:02:06.215 --> 00:02:12.069
Choosing an appropriate metric is highly contingent on your particular situation.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.139
In the upcoming concepts,

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:18.319
you will become more familiar with these metrics and we'll see

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.039
why some metrics just don't work as well for our situation.
