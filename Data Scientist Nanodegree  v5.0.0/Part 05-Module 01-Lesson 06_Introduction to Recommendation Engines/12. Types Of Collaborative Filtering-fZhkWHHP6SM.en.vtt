In the last video,

00:00:06.815 --> 00:00:09.339
you got an introduction to collaborative filtering.

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.789
The name collaborative filtering comes from the idea that we can

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.589
use user item collaborations to make recommendations.

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.780
What this means is that even without

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.450
any background information about the users and

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.210
without background information about the items,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.429
we can still make recommendations.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:34.590
The only information we need is data about how users and items interact with one another.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.955
Recommendations that require information about users and items are considered

00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:43.189
content-based recommendation systems which will

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:46.689
be the last type of recommendation we will cover in this lesson.

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:49.609
For now, let's take a closer look at

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.109
the type of information we need for collaborative filtering.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.269
The type of data that could be used for the purposes of

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.100
collaborative filtering includes data that answers questions like,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.450
how have users rated certain items?

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.049
Or which items have users liked or disliked?

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.120
We could even go as far as asking whether or not a user has used each item.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.960
But again, we don't need to know any additional context about the users or the items.
