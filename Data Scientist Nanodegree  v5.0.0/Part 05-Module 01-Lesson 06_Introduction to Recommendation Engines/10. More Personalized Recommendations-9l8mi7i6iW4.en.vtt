00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
Now, you've implemented a method

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.519
for recommending the most popular items to any user.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.230
This method frequently works well for

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.754
trending events which you see on Twitter and Facebook,

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:20.109
as well as when you don't know a lot about your users.

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.809
It's easier to just pick

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:26.149
the most popular events and use them as a recommendation for everyone.

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:32.074
However, this way of making recommendations is not very personalized to the user.

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:35.570
Instead, we can make better recommendations by using

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.725
information about how users have interacted with items in the past.

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:45.770
This would lead to more personalized and therefore, better recommendations.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.210
Recommending Titanic for every user because it's one of

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.950
the most popular movies of all time probably doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.420
Because the recommendation would be totally irrelevant to a household

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.415
whose entire watch history is comprised of children's educational shows.

00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:08.390
Using interactions between users and items is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.450
a very common approach used by retailers to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.930
create better recommendations for their customers.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.400
Here is a snapshot of what my landing page at Amazon looks like.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.090
I regularly received recommendations from Amazon for books

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.875
related to statistics and machine learning because of my earlier purchasing habits.

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:29.980
In the next parts of this lesson,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.240
we'll look at different ways we might go about

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:35.319
providing more personalized recommendations.
