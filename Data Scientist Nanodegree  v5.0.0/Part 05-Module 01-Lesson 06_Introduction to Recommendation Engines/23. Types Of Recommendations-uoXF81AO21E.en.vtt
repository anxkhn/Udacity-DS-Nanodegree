00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.950
You've now built a recommender based on each of

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.515
the three main ways people create recommendations: knowledge based recommendations,

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:15.740
collaborative filtering based recommendations,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.969
and content based recommendations.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:19.834
In the first recommendation,

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:23.460
you filtered movies by year and genre allowing you to

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.745
recommend top movies based on which movies best met that criteria.

00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:31.275
This was an example of knowledge based recommendations.

00:00:31.274 --> 00:00:34.199
Knowledge based recommendations are common for

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.710
luxury or rare purchases like jewelry, cars, or homes.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.149
For example, the filters used when looking at homes on Zillow is

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.875
an example of users getting back items that meet a certain criteria.

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:54.225
Certain filters are the most common way that knowledge recommendations are implemented.

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:56.160
In the second recommendation,

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.779
we use ratings from many users across items in

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.250
a collaborative way to recommend new items to users.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.890
This is called collaborative filtering and it's

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.534
the most common way that recommendations are made.

00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:14.405
The final type of recommender is called content based recommendation.

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:19.114
Content based recommenders use information about similarities

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:25.479
between items to make recommendations like you did with the year and genre of movies.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.805
Often, the most sophisticated recommendation engines

00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:31.459
allow for recommendations using filters,

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:33.670
user, and item ratings,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.295
as well as information about the items.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:40.700
Even though these are the three main ways to make recommendations, knowledge based,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.454
collaborative filtering based, and content based,

00:01:43.454 --> 00:01:47.149
there are a number of other ways recommendations can be made.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.760
Further discussion about recommendations is provided in the text on the next page.
