00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970
Next we'll look at Spearman's correlation coefficient,

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.405
and with Spearman's correlation coefficient,

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:07.705
we're working with ranks.

00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:10.679
So, everything about Spearman's is a rank.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.355
So, this gives you an example of what those ranks would look like.

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:17.160
So, the rank values here are one

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.199
through seven even though the raw values are negative three through three.

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.399
So this is the smallest,

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:22.604
so it gets a rank of one,

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.899
and this is the second smallest, so it gets a rank of two.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.489
So, you can see that just uses this rank function.

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.524
Then, if you look at the formula,

00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:33.659
it looks a lot like what we just did except for

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.719
these little r's floating around and that's because essentially,

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.195
what we're going to do is we're going to change our original array

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:44.765
to a ranked version of that array before we apply any formulas to it.

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:48.439
Great. So, if we want to do Spearman's correlation coefficient,

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:53.920
I'm just going to x.rank and y equals y.rank.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.570
So, if we calculate the ranks first,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.679
then x and y are being held as the ranked versions of them,

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:06.640
and then essentially this should just look like exactly what we did up here.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.525
I should make this pretty straightforward.

00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:12.469
So, we'll take the mean.

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.179
X is now the ranked version,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.310
y is the ranked version.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.879
We'll take the differences.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:19.170
It's like this. We'll calculate

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.700
the same standard deviation things in the denominator. I think that should work.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.700
So, it looks like we got everything right there.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.840
Now, a couple of questions about why this is important.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.100
If when x increases,

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:35.724
y also increases, will Spearman's correlation be one.

00:01:35.724 --> 00:01:37.629
And that's actually true. All right.

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:43.569
So, spearman's correlation is a measure of that two things move monotonically.

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:44.809
That is, they always move in

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.689
the same direction or do they not move in the same direction,

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.634
whereas Pearson's correlation is do they move linearly, exactly linearly.

00:01:52.635 --> 00:01:55.935
So, for all cases where Pearson's is one,

00:01:55.935 --> 00:01:57.530
Spearman will also be one.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.329
But that's not true vice versa.

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.370
For all cases where Spearman is one,

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.439
Pearson is not necessarily one.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.810
If when x increases by one and this decreases,

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.360
this is also true and this last one is also true.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.405
So, all of these are monotonic changes,

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:18.169
and therefore, for all of them Spearman's will be true.
