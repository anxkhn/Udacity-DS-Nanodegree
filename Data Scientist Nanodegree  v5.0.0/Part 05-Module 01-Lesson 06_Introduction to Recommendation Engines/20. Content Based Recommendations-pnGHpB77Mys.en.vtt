00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.820
You might have noticed that when using collaborative filtering,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.635
we still had a lot of users who are left without any recommendations.

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:17.489
If you're just starting out with building out your recommendation engine,

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:21.844
you might not have any users or you might not have very many.

00:00:21.844 --> 00:00:28.254
In this case, it might be really difficult or even impossible to find similar users.

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:33.570
So, how can we make recommendations when we don't have users to compare to one another?

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.314
In these cases, we can use content-based recommendation methods.

00:00:38.314 --> 00:00:41.984
Imagine you find out that a customer purchased a bike.

00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:45.019
I have a few guesses of items you might like.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.130
You might also need a bike helmet,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.700
or a bike tire pump,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.550
or a bike light, or a bike reflectors,

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:53.994
or other biking related items.

00:00:53.994 --> 00:00:56.924
Depending on the types of items you're recommending,

00:00:56.924 --> 00:01:00.409
finding similar items could be based on the name of the item,

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.389
like with these bike related items.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.849
Or if we're shopping for clothing,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.375
we might recommend clothing that looks similar.

00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:09.325
If we're recommending movies,

00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:12.079
we might recommend movies in the same genre.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:17.450
Using this type of information is called content-based recommendations.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.380
Once you start gaining additional users,

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:24.920
it's often useful to use a blend of many recommendation techniques.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.814
But with limited users,

00:01:26.814 --> 00:01:30.840
content-based recommenders often come in handy.
