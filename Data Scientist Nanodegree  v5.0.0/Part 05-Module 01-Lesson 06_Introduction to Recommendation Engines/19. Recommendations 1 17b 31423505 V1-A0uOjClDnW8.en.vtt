00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.559
Now, from there, we have this function that makes recommendations,

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:07.769
and essentially, we can use that to make

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:09.494
recommendations for all of our users.

00:00:09.494 --> 00:00:12.434
That's what this final function is going to do.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:15.400
I'll show you how I did it.

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:23.354
This is pulling only the unique users from the first column.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.949
There might be other ways that you could pull the users,

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.530
that would be pretty much the same.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.795
Then I'm going to pull the number of users as the length of this.

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:35.045
Then I'm going to create all recs,

00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:36.649
which is just going to be a dictionary

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.989
where I'm going to store the recommendations.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.065
So what this will look like is, the key will be the user,

00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:45.739
and then the values will be the recommendations for that user.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:54.150
Then I'll say, for user in users, so for each user, all recs.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.009
Hope that user are going to be equal to

00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:03.414
the make recommendations per user,

00:01:03.414 --> 00:01:05.340
and I'm passing in the number recs,

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.310
but you could potentially work for that if you wanted to.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.740
Great. So again, this is probably the only part

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.479
that you really need if you want to,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.295
because this takes a little bit of time.

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:22.129
It could be useful to again create this progress bar like you did before,

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:25.670
so you can just copy and paste that and move it down here.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.219
So here, we're creating the progress bar,

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.025
and users is still the value here.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.290
That makes sense.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.495
I don't need to change anything down there.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:39.395
Here's my calendar, and I'll add that,

00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:50.024
and then I'm just going to have bar finish.

00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:58.365
Great. So bar finish, and I'll see how this goes.

00:01:58.364 --> 00:02:02.174
There's an error. I have error, movie list.

00:02:02.174 --> 00:02:05.989
Oh, I missed a bracket up there somewhere.

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:10.229
Right here. Go away then.
