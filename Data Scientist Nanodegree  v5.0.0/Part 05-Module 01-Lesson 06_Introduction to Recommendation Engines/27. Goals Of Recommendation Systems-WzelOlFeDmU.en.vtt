00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.175
Businesses care about recommendation systems because they are

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.595
often central to how the business drives revenue.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:16.310
There are often four goals of recommenders that can help drive revenue.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.169
The first of these is the most obvious,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.095
and that is relevance.

00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:24.989
We want to make recommendations that are relevant to users.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.409
Consumers are more likely to engage with and use items that are relevant.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.560
Therefore, this is key.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.134
The second goal is novelty.

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:37.905
While we want to recommend items that are relevant,

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:40.370
it is ideal if a recommended item is

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:43.409
not something that the user has been exposed to already.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:46.934
This means finding novel items for a particular user.

00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:49.820
The third goal is serendipity.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.609
Often this is confused with novelty.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.704
Recommendations that are serendipitous are truly surprising to a user.

00:00:57.704 --> 00:01:00.484
If a user listens to classic rock music,

00:01:00.484 --> 00:01:06.435
a novel recommendation is a new classic rock song that the user has not heard of before.

00:01:06.435 --> 00:01:10.250
However, a serendipitous recommendation is one that might come

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.234
from a different genre that the user is surprised that they like.

00:01:14.234 --> 00:01:18.349
This goal is often much more difficult to implement and involves

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:22.789
a mix of collaborative filtering and content-based methods to implement well.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.660
The final goal is to increase recommendation diversity.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.814
Again, this is not simple to implement.

00:01:29.814 --> 00:01:34.564
Recommender systems often recommend lots of similar items.

00:01:34.564 --> 00:01:38.390
Creating recommendation list that are diverse give it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.829
the greatest chance that at least one item will be enjoyed by the user.

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.010
What's more, diversifying recommendations

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.160
lowers the chance that a user will get bored of the recommendations.
