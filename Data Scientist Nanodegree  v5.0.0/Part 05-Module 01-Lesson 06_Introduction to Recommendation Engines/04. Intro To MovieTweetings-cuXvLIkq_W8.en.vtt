00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.000
In this lesson, we'll be working with the MovieTweetings data,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.890
a movie rating dataset collected by

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.210
Simon Dooms and innovation agency in Belgium using Twitter.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.570
You'll learn about some of the most common techniques for creating

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.010
recommendations as you work with this data collected using MovieTweetings.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.585
As you build each recommendation,

00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:29.350
think about the pros and cons of each of the recommenders,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.719
and how you might improve the recommendations.
