00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:08.250
If you were looking to make a recommendation of a book,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.144
a movie, or a song,

00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:11.744
how might you do it?

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:15.969
You might just recommend the most popular item in that category.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.824
Catcher in the Rye is the most popular book,

00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:21.250
so I just recommend that to every reader.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.585
Despacito is a popular song,

00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:26.405
so I'd recommend this to every listener.

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:28.984
Titanic is a popular movie,

00:00:28.984 --> 00:00:32.304
so let's recommend that as a movie for everyone.

00:00:32.304 --> 00:00:34.375
As a small extension,

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:37.070
you might allow individuals to filter for

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.924
the most popular items according to specific categories.

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:44.974
Instead of recommending any of the most popular movies,

00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:49.054
perhaps, we want to filter to only allow dramatic movies.

00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:54.875
Adding a filter for the dramatic movies would select only these from the most popular.

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:58.729
Adding a filter like this turns this recommendation from

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.909
simply a ranked-based recommendation system into

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.584
what is known as a knowledge-based recommendation system.

00:01:05.584 --> 00:01:09.544
A ranked-based recommendation system orders items

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:12.799
according to some criteria like most liked,

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.174
most purchases, or most listened to.

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:19.984
Knowledge-based recommendation systems have users provide

00:01:19.984 --> 00:01:25.204
context about the item or their preferences to make a recommendation.

00:01:25.204 --> 00:01:31.069
Adding a filter so that a user can choose a specific genre or specific year

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:32.959
that a movie was produced is

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.439
a very common way to introduce knowledge-based recommendations.
