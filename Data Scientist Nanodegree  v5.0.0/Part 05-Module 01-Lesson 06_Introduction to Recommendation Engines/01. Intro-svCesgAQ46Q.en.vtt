00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:08.414
Welcome to this lesson on Recommendation Engines.

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:10.529
Recommendation engines are one of

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.949
the most important data science applications in use today.

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.769
Data science is being used to recommend everything from

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.405
music and movies to friends and new destinations.

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:24.000
In this lesson, you'll learn about some of

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.329
the most common methods used to build recommendations.

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.324
These methods fall into three main categories: Knowledge-based recommendations,

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:37.125
content-based recommendations, and collaborative filtering-based recommendations.

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:40.710
This will serve as a strong foundation to build upon in

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.189
the following lessons where you'll be ready to

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:46.679
look at more advanced recommendation techniques.
