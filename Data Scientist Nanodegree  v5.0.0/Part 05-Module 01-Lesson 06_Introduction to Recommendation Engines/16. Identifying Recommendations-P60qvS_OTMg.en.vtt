00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.455
Using the similarity and distance metrics you saw previously,

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:12.419
you'll now be able to identify similar users.

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:18.105
But we need to be able to use information about these users to make recommendations.

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:20.730
It can be a bit of an art mixed with

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.798
science to figure out how many users we'll want to get recommendations

00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:28.469
from as well as identifying which and

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:33.655
how many items should be recommended from each of these users.

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:36.435
Let's bring back Sam again.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:40.640
One way we could make recommendations for Sam is to take all of

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.280
the movies that the closest neighbors have seen and recommend these movies.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.760
However, recommending all of these items without any sort of

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:54.454
filter will likely lead to recommending movies that Sam has already seen.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:57.604
We would definitely want to make sure we remove

00:00:57.604 --> 00:01:01.829
any items Sam has already viewed from our pile of recommendations.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.390
Additionally, just because one of Sam's neighbors has

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.219
viewed a movie doesn't mean they actually liked it.

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:16.030
If Sam and his neighbor have similar tastes and Jessie didn't like a particular movie,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.870
then Sam probably won't like it either.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.875
If Jesse has a rating for all of these items she's viewed,

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:27.980
we might say we're only going to recommend items that she's rated positively.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.520
Given that our data are on a 10-point scale,

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:37.179
we might only recommend movies to Sam that's rated at seven or higher.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.850
Now that we've found the movies from the neighbors,

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:43.839
removed the movies Sam has already seen,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.465
and removed the movies that were not rated highly,

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:49.880
we have our recommendations for Sam.

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:55.959
Let's take a closer look at implementing these techniques to make recommendations.
