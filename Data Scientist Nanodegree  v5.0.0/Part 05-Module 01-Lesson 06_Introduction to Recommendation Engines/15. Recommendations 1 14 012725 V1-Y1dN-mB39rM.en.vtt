00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.610
In this notebook, you're looking at different measures of similarity and distance.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.710
This will be more of a test on the ability to move math to code than anything else.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.480
Being able to move from math to code and vice versa,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.060
is a really useful skill as you want to gain

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.239
more flexibility in creating models of your own.

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.274
Let's get started and look at a few of the most popular techniques.

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:29.509
At the top here, you can see that we'll be looking at three measures of similarity;

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.920
one is the Pearson's correlation coefficient,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.145
another is the Spearman's correlation coefficient,

00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:35.610
and the third is Kendall's Tau.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.155
Pearson's correlation coefficient has an equation that looks like this.

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:42.950
So, our first task is to essentially calculate

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.685
the Pearson's correlation coefficient for any two arrays.

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:48.365
The first thing that I wanted to do,

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:53.570
was just calculate the mean for each observation for each individual array.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.384
So, I'm going to create,

00:00:55.384 --> 00:00:58.909
what I'll call mean X and mean Y.

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:05.840
Essentially, we can get this by taking the sum of X divided by the length of X.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.365
So, I'm just following this equation here saying,

00:01:08.364 --> 00:01:10.939
the mean for X is going to be this and we could

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.799
also make a separate function for this is we wanted to.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.869
So, now we have the mean for both of those things,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.240
and then essentially what we want to do is get these parts.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:25.579
So, you'll see that this part shows up over and over again throughout

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.034
the equation where we're taking Y minus Y bar,

00:01:29.034 --> 00:01:31.435
Y minus Y bar, X minus X bar.

00:01:31.435 --> 00:01:37.284
So, we can do that by essentially taking if these X's and Y's are arrays,

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:42.304
we can just take the difference between that array and the mean.

00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:45.550
Let's call it X diffs.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:52.500
We'll call this Y diffs and it's going to be equal to the same thing.

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:57.674
We could set this up the same way we did up there.

00:01:57.674 --> 00:02:03.090
Say Y diffs part.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.170
Let's just take this part.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.520
Great.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.515
Cool. So, now that we have those differences,

00:02:11.514 --> 00:02:12.989
we can compute out the rest of this.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.480
So, what we want to do is in this top part for each element in this array,

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:18.694
we want to multiply it by

00:02:18.694 --> 00:02:23.069
that same index of that element in the Y diffs array and then essentially,

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.525
we just want to sum them together.

00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:27.590
So, that will give us this numerator part up here.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.765
So, if we take np sum of X diffs.

00:02:33.764 --> 00:02:38.064
So, that's essentially this whole thing,

00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:43.359
and we just want to multiply that by Y diffs. All right.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.480
Then, this part summing them all up.

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:52.234
Then, we want to take X diffs squared and,

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:55.700
then basically we want to sum that up.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.520
We want to take the square root.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.010
So, that's giving us this part over here and we want to do

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:12.449
the same thing with this part over here but with the Y portion.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:24.629
All right. So, I'm just going to make sure that we are, not that it should matter.

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:30.579
So, we're going to take this np sum of these two things together,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.000
and we're going to divide it by essentially squaring

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.330
these things and then summing them all

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.540
together and then taking the square root and then doing that same thing for the Y's.

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:49.625
So, this should give us our correlation coefficient which we can return back.

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:51.969
Then, the cell is to test,

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.719
and it looks like we pass all the tests.

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.699
So, now that you've computed Pearson's correlation coefficient,

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.605
we can answer a few questions about it.

00:03:59.604 --> 00:04:01.719
So, if when X increases,

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.889
Y also increases, Pearson's correlation will always be one.

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.134
So, that's actually not true.

00:04:06.134 --> 00:04:11.929
So, you can imagine things that are increasing but not in a line.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.689
So, Pearson's correlation coefficient always is defined by a line,

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:19.139
and if they increase by like a quadratic,

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.534
this statement is true.

00:04:20.535 --> 00:04:22.360
But Pearson's correlation will not be one.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.449
If when X increases by one,

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.349
Y always increases by three, the correlation will be one.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.085
So, that's actually a true statement.

00:04:29.084 --> 00:04:34.229
Great. So, that one's true.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.100
That's essentially a line. So, X increases by one,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.295
Y increases by three.

00:04:38.295 --> 00:04:39.535
X increases by one,

00:04:39.535 --> 00:04:42.980
Y increases by three and that's going to be a true statement.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.935
So similarly, if X increases by one,

00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:48.064
Y always decreases by five,

00:04:48.064 --> 00:04:49.610
this will always be a negative one.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.220
That's actually a true statement as well.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.775
So, that's another line.

00:04:52.774 --> 00:04:55.574
That'll create another line.

00:04:55.574 --> 00:04:58.089
Then, if when X increases by one,

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.844
Y increases by three times X.

00:05:00.845 --> 00:05:02.505
That's no longer a line.

00:05:02.504 --> 00:05:07.519
So, this falls into one of the scenarios up here that would be false.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:12.029
So, that would actually be a false statement.

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:16.954
All right. So, B. That's right.

00:05:16.954 --> 00:05:19.620
There's a little explanation there.
