00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.069
You now have learned more about what data scientists do,

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:05.714
from both Juno and I, as well as from our partners.

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:09.689
It's important that you tie those ideas back to what you're doing in the classroom.

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:11.424
The first part of this program,

00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:14.080
you'll work with libraries like scikit-learn to implement

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.015
machine learning across a whole bunch of different projects.

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:18.574
Juno, in the second term,

00:00:18.574 --> 00:00:19.949
what will students be working on?

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.109
Yes. So, in the second term you'll use a lot of those technical pieces

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.619
and see how they fit into the larger picture of the data science process,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.240
like framing the problem and communicating with stakeholders and technical teams.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.439
You'll also learn a lot of the skills that are

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.530
necessary for industry like important software engineering practices.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.300
So, we have a lot of exciting stuff to cover.

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:40.119
Let's get started.
