00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.660
There's not really a typical day as a data scientist.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.630
But there's always some component where we are working with the other teams around us,

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.925
mainly that means the marketing team,

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:22.450
or the technology team.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.370
You can make the greatest model in the world,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.050
but if you can't deliver it,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.955
and nobody wants it, then what's the point?

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:32.005
There some part of the day that's for writing code,

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:34.350
and that's anything from SQL for data exploration,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.600
to Python, or Spark for more media work.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.000
Two important parts that you're going to wear,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.310
you're going to have to end up wearing a couple of hats;

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.045
one is of course just the technical abilities.

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:51.550
So, familiarity with statistics,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.970
comfortable with mathematics in general, but the next trick,

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.120
and this one comes up a lot especially from talking to other mathematicians,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.500
the ability to program is essential,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.290
it's mainly to gathering and clean your data.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.960
Data Science gets its 80 percent data munching,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.250
it's 90 percent data munching,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.510
less numbers get thrown around,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.040
but there's a lot of data munching.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.890
Just putting your hands on that data and working with it is

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.925
something you need to be able to do by yourself to really start to appreciate.

00:01:19.925 --> 00:01:24.650
Does that mean you have to be a professional programmer in order to do Data Science?

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.260
I don't consider myself a professional programmer.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.995
I've actually no formal training in code,

00:01:29.995 --> 00:01:35.040
but I have spent a large portion of my life writing code one way or another.
