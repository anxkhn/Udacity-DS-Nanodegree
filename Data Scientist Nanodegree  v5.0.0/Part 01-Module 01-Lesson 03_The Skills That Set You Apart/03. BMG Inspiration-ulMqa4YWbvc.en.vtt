00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
So, I'm really interested

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.355
it's what I call bridging the gap between the poets and the quants.

00:00:06.355 --> 00:00:10.679
The idea is to make numbers tell a story and speak to

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.089
people who are not necessarily accustomed to working with data,

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.815
to make it into a story that they can digest,

00:00:17.815 --> 00:00:19.845
understand and act upon.

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:23.129
So, I started out as a literary agent and studied

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:25.799
English literature and I realized that I was

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.920
actually interested in transitioning to the business side of media.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.219
So, during my MBA I focused on statistics and big data electives wherever I could and I

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.545
also pursued my own online learning to learn the coding bits and the technical bit.

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:41.495
Just after the MBA I joined

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:44.129
the Bertelsmann group in the Bertelsmann entrepreneurs program.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.550
In terms of the music industry at large,

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:50.819
the main applications of data science are around streaming.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.460
So how do people discover music?

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.035
How are they consuming music?

00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:57.649
Especially being able to track the path from

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.655
discovery to becoming a fan on streaming services.

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:06.614
Finding new acts, how can you automate some of that search especially

00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:11.539
given the explosion of just the amount of content that is out there,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.880
also just around being able to forecast and predict sales,

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:19.545
how much stock you should hold of final NCD's for example.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:23.480
For me, it was really an experience of realizing that you can teach

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.570
yourself a tremendous amount of skills and especially technical skills.

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.939
I as somebody who originally was maybe afraid of things

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.855
like coding was able to just with persistence teach myself something,

00:01:36.855 --> 00:01:38.990
and I feel like that's something that can really scale

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:41.969
because if I can do it really anybody can.
