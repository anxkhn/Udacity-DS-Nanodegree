00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.254
So, I'm joined with Robert from Airbnb.

00:00:02.254 --> 00:00:03.705
Robert, thanks so much for joining us.

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:05.084
Thank you for having me.

00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:07.299
Can you first, maybe give us some advice,

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.169
about how you would go about breaking into the field of data science?

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.394
A lot of our students are just starting out.

00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:16.214
I would say the first thing is,

00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:18.089
focus on the fundamentals.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:23.089
I think this is a relatively new field and there's sort of new innovations,

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.265
new technology coming out,

00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:27.219
pretty much like every week.

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:32.914
So, it's almost impossible to kind of keep up with things.

00:00:32.914 --> 00:00:36.414
You can always pick up more stuff if you have good fundamentals.

00:00:36.414 --> 00:00:40.519
Yeah, so what are the fundamental areas that you would push toward?

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.555
Yes, that's a good question. Just basic knowledge around statistics,

00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:50.000
and basic working knowledge of just dealing with computers.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.210
So, these could be things like,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.134
knowing how to query data,

00:00:55.134 --> 00:00:58.094
knowing how to interact with a command line tool.

00:00:58.094 --> 00:01:02.644
Can we talk a little bit about the different roles of data scientists, on your teams?

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:03.965
What do they do?

00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:06.350
What differentiates their skillset?

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:08.119
I don't know if you're a part of hiring,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.609
but what are those things that you look for when you're hiring

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.314
candidates that fall into certain data science teams?

00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:18.185
Yeah, we have physicists, former physicists,

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:20.765
we have former social scientists,

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:23.700
we have people who study statistics,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.140
computer science, operations research,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.704
and it's kind of all over the place.

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:35.840
I think the common theme is that people have spent a lot of time doing analytical works,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.605
and they're very analytical-driven and very data-driven.

00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:41.520
So, that's like the whole culture?

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:45.989
That's the whole culture. Those are the things that we really look for.

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:49.339
So, we're not really looking at you know someone

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.965
who's graduated from a particular score or degree.

00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:57.295
But let me describe a little bit how we think about it at Airbnb.

00:01:57.295 --> 00:02:00.140
At Airbnb we have three tracks;

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.435
the first track is called Analytics.

00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:06.944
Typically these are people who focus a lot on business intelligence,

00:02:06.944 --> 00:02:10.129
trying to understand the trends of the business,

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.870
how we're doing as a business.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.564
So, it's generally quite high level and

00:02:15.564 --> 00:02:21.329
your stakeholders are generally people who are decision makers.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.630
So, it could be product managers,

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.960
it could be the lead of entire product work.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.205
The type of work that you do typically

00:02:29.205 --> 00:02:35.165
are sort of a little bit more high level. So that's Analytics.

00:02:35.164 --> 00:02:38.584
Then we have people who are on an inference track.

00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:45.740
For inference people, we typically do a lot of experiment design.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.780
You typically work very closely with a full-stack team

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.754
where that team is responsible for trying out different product iterations.

00:02:54.754 --> 00:02:59.664
It's very common for tech companies now day to run AB tests.

00:02:59.664 --> 00:03:06.289
So, data scientists are very valuable in helping and design the experiment set up,

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:12.409
determining how long the experiment should be run for and making sure that we're tracking

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.270
the right metric so we can understand the behavioral change

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.445
of the new product versus the old product,

00:03:19.444 --> 00:03:21.514
and in doing product analytics.

00:03:21.514 --> 00:03:24.279
I think this is true for both inference and analytics.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:32.740
There's a lot of analyses around how users are actually using our products.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.520
Then we have the third track, which is algorithm.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.830
This is a track where people spend a lot of time building data products.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.530
So, it could be something like

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.270
a recommendation engine or it could be an image model that does image classification.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.604
So, they typically focus more on

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:00.819
specific modelling projects or

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.299
data products rather than trying to explain the trend of the business.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.770
But I will say the tracking system is more of a guidance.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.715
I will say a lot of people at Airbnb do cross-works.

00:04:15.715 --> 00:04:19.490
I certainly have done pretty much all tracks.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:25.810
I think that's kind of the nature of working as a data scientist which

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:33.050
is depending on what product we're building,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.129
you would try to use the right tool to solve that problem.

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:38.659
That tool could be analytics,

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.520
could be experiment design, could be modelling.

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:44.519
So, being able to kind of juggle around with

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:49.115
the different tools in your tool set is an important skill to have.

00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:49.639
Cool.
