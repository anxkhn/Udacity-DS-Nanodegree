00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
You're about to start this data scientists nanodegree program,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.019
but before we get started,

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:09.914
it's probably important to talk a little bit about what do data scientists actually do.

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:11.454
So, to do that,

00:00:11.455 --> 00:00:16.065
Juno and I both have experience working as data scientists in practice,

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:18.420
and Juno, can you give the students

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.485
a little insight into what your role look like as a data scientist?

00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:24.390
Sure. So I was a data scientist at a smaller startup.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.894
So, I had a few different roles.

00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:29.355
About 20 percent of my role was more in business analytics,

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:32.250
and actually I worked a lot with the software development team,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.880
to make sure that before I did any data science,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.929
the data that was being recorded was clean and standardized so that it made sense.

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:42.530
I gave things like activity reports on

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.255
what kind of users and products were happening at the time.

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:49.280
About 80 percent of my role was on longer-term data science projects,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.590
where I worked on a recommender system,

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.855
that recommended different products to users,

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:58.250
and also just making sense of the information we have in our database,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.140
such as clusters of similar products we had,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.350
or insights for our users.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.180
I heard your role as a data scientist was a bit different,

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.730
could you share a little bit about that?

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.219
Yes. So, I was a data scientist at a larger company,

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.709
and the communication and your role sounds like it was mostly with software developers.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.949
Yeah.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.730
Mine was very customer facing,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.299
and so that meant,

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.200
most of the time my audience was a less technical audience,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.540
and it was important for me to make sure that they

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.070
understood what they were going to get from what we were working on,

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:30.479
from a business perspective.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.359
The tools that we were using were probably very similar.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.500
I used things related to natural language processing and clustering,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.969
used sort of a Python toolkit,

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.525
something that students will be learning in this program.

00:01:42.525 --> 00:01:47.620
From there, it's probably important that we give more insight than just ours.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.030
So, you'll hear from some of our partners,

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.500
and they'll give you some insight into what they do as data scientists

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.400
as well as what they look for in candidates when they're hiring data scientists.
