00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
At Airbnb, where you were before Coinbase,

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:09.870
can you talk about maybe like chains of command in terms of we have

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:13.289
data analysts and this is the types of problems that they work on or even

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.089
like we have data scientists that do this versus we have data scientists who do this,

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.179
and this is how we sort of differentiate maybe when

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.509
you're hiring for them or the skill sets that we're looking for in those people.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.780
One of the things definitely I would encourage anyone who's

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.320
thinking about data science role is to try to disambiguate what it means,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.960
because it can mean a dozen different things and will change with

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.365
every single company that is hiring data scientists.

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:42.164
So, I'll try to give some of the more specific ones first.

00:00:42.164 --> 00:00:46.969
So, often companies will have algorithms or machine learning data scientists.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.844
They are specifically in charge of

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:53.420
a very valuable algorithm that the company needs in order to survive.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.439
So, that might be for example a search algorithm.

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:59.629
At Airbnb when you type in a location,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.950
like that ordered list is extremely influential to the business.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.930
There's a team of data scientists and engineers who work on that.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.640
That's like most of what they do.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.814
So, that sort of algorithms and data science or algorithms and machine learning.

00:01:13.814 --> 00:01:15.620
There's a kind of the role that

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.290
we've just been talking about in terms of experimentation,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.590
which is saying all right we're looking to make these changes,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.090
what should we measure,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.515
how do we make sure the data lands in a place where it can be measured?

00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:28.939
That sort of role which is a little bit of

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.405
a generalist in terms of you need some statistics background,

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:34.010
you need to know some data engineering,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.040
and also some of those communication skills that we're just talking about.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.890
There's maybe even a third layer,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.215
which is more concentrated on high-level business analysis.

00:01:45.215 --> 00:01:49.430
Starting to get more even towards financial planning analysis roles or

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.725
business analysts and that

00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:54.969
might be termed data analyst or might be termed data scientists,

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.304
but at that point you're thinking about these high level metrics,

00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:01.120
the right cuts for those metrics,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.329
the display for those metrics to executives or

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.664
other business leaders and making sure that for example we know when those things change,

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:12.185
can explain what happened,

00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:13.444
those sorts of questions.

00:02:13.444 --> 00:02:15.500
Super insightful. Can you talk

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.750
about maybe the toolkits that those people have and how they're different?

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.025
So, like one of the first algorithms person is that like,

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:26.504
you need to know C++, you need to have like really strong CS skills.

00:02:26.504 --> 00:02:28.590
Then the second is maybe more Python.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.460
Then the third one almost sounds like even tools,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.070
like dashboard tools like Tableau and things like that.

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.354
Is that the toolkits or are there different tools that you've seen used in those roles?

00:02:38.354 --> 00:02:43.394
For example on the machine learning side,

00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:46.170
you're going to see different tools used across the board.

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.479
So, you definitely see more things like C++ in places

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:53.354
where they need extremely good performance or maybe embedded devices.

00:02:53.354 --> 00:02:57.009
Autonomous driving being pretty clear recent example.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.909
But that might also be people using something like

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:06.504
Scikit-learn or TensorFlow or any of those sorts of Python tools for example.

00:03:06.504 --> 00:03:09.754
The general stroll you'd assume more,

00:03:09.754 --> 00:03:11.949
I guess for both generalist and machine learning you

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.424
see some of that data engineering toolkit,

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:19.330
which are both the abstraction layers like airflow and

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.010
also the sort of underlying engines which are things like distributed SQL engines,

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.819
Hive, Presto, also things like Spark,

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.984
Flink these sorts of jobs,

00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:33.020
so that you can get the data you need and put it where you need to be.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:40.409
Then you see more of the analysis and visualization layer for the high-level picture,

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.799
which could be dashboarding tools like Tableau, Looker, Superset.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.820
Then data access layer is probably SQL,

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.364
but there's some other options too.

00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:53.080
Cool.
