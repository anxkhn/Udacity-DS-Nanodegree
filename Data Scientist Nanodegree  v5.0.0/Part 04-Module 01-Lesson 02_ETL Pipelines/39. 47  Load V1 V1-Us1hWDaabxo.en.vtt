00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.900
There's one last step to an ETL pipeline we haven't talked about yet, load.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.280
Now that you've transformed the data,

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.469
you'll want to store the data somewhere,

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.324
otherwise you'd lose all your work.

00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:21.980
There are so many options for data storage.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.379
What you choose will depend on your needs.

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:27.114
For example, with structured data,

00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:30.320
a relational database like SQL could be appropriate.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.899
If your data fits in a Pandas DataFrame,

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.649
then a CSV file might work well.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.449
Part of a data engineer's job is to know how to work with different data storage options.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.554
Below the video, you'll find a few links about popular data storage systems beyond SQL,

00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:50.164
CSV, and Json files.

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:54.054
I'll show you a couple of ways to load data using Python,

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.479
and then you'll get some practice doing it on your own.
