00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
So, Robert can you talk a little bit about maybe advice that you would give to

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.669
yourself and also maybe like what keeps you going in the world of data science.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.820
Yeah. Definitely, the number one thing that I recommend is just focus on

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.740
the fundamentals and these are things like basic computing skills,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.179
basic statistics knowledge, good analytical mindset,

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.370
SQL, so and so forth.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.940
The second thing that I think it's very important is to look for a company

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.460
that is willing or has been investing in data engineering.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.009
So, having a solid data infrastructure team,

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:36.990
having a solid engineering team,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.210
and have a reasonable data warehouse,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.785
which you can extract data and play with the data.

00:00:42.784 --> 00:00:48.464
My first job I was literally executing SQL script in tendon by

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.470
hand to now we're using airflow and we can do

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.240
very sophisticated stuff and everything is automated.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.179
So, there's definitely best practices that can be learned.

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:04.769
So, it sounds like you're saying also for companies anyway, having data engineers,

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.849
and figuring out what you want to store and

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:10.984
how it's going to be stored is like almost more important

00:01:10.984 --> 00:01:15.680
than bringing on data scientists who are supposed to tell you what to do

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.430
with data until you have a plan and you're storing the right things.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.450
Yeah, I think the person who articulated this best is Monica Rogati.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.185
She wrote also on media and she wrote a post called "The AI Hierarchial Needs."

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:36.064
She described how like basically analytics are build in layers

00:01:36.064 --> 00:01:38.480
and you have to start from the foundation and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.280
the foundation is like having your data infrastructure in place,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.700
having your ETL in place,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.950
data warehouse and only after then can you do things like analytics,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.630
experimentation, and machine learning.

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:49.744
I think that's very, very true.

00:01:49.745 --> 00:01:53.750
They always talk about after years of hard work finally,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.215
they are able to achieve this,

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:59.549
but then they didn't really talk about of all the things that happened like before then.

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:07.349
But that's really how any big and important data projects are built,

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.000
it's layer upon layers.
