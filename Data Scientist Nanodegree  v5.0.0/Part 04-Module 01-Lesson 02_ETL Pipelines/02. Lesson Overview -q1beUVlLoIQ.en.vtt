00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:08.339
Here's what you're going to work on in this lesson.

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.240
First, you'll practice extracting data from various sources

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.585
such as CSV files, databases, and APIs.

00:00:16.585 --> 00:00:19.980
Then, you'll transform data using different techniques

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.385
like data cleaning and removing outliers.

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:27.234
Next, you'll write code to load data into a database.

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:30.270
Finally, you'll put all of this together into

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.325
a single ETL pipeline that gets the data ready for further analysis.

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:40.990
This lesson is built around small data sets that can fit on your local computer.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.195
I'm providing data from the World Bank that you can practice with.

00:00:45.195 --> 00:00:49.219
However, these days, data engineers work with

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.725
massive distributed data sets that won't fit on a single machine.

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:57.155
This is often referred to as big data.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:00.170
Udacity has other courses about how to deal with

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.950
data sets that are too big for your personal computer to handle.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.650
Continue on to get started with ETL pipelines.
