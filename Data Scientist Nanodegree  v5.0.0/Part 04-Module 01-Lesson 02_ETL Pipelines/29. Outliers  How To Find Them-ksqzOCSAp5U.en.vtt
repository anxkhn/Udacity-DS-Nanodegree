00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.294
An outlier is a data point that is far away from the rest of the data.

00:00:10.294 --> 00:00:14.759
Outliers can appear in your data for similar reasons to missing data.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.109
An outlier could be due to a data entry error or a processing mistake,

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.210
or an outlier might be legitimate data because, in any situation,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.490
there's always some probability of obtaining an extreme value.

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.139
The questions to ask yourself are;

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.670
how do you find outliers,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.560
and then once you found them,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.160
what do you do with them?

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:39.409
First, I'll introduce a few ways for detecting

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.414
outliers and then talk about what to do with outliers.

00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:46.274
When working in one or two dimensions,

00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:49.954
you can use data visualizations to spot outliers.

00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:52.155
In the case of one dimensional data,

00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:54.685
you can plot the data along a number line.

00:00:54.685 --> 00:00:58.130
A data point that falls far to the left or far to

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.030
the right of most of the data could be considered an outlier.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.275
You can also spot outliers using two dimensional plots.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:11.435
In this plot, it's clear that one point is far away from the other data points.

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:14.629
There are also statistical methods for finding outliers,

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:17.795
and I'll give you some practice in the coding exercises.

00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:22.969
These include using z-scores from a normal distribution or the two-key method.

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.465
Both of these methods use basic statistics like means,

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:30.409
standard deviations, or quantiles to

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.500
identify outliers that are far away from most of the data.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.269
So far, we've talked about finding outliers in one or two dimensions.

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:42.709
How do you find outliers in three or more dimensions?

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:44.284
You could, for example,

00:01:44.284 --> 00:01:49.939
use machine learning techniques like PCA to reduce the data to one or two dimensions.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.754
Then you could use the graphical or statistical methods already discussed.

00:01:54.754 --> 00:01:58.444
Another example would be to use a clustering method.

00:01:58.444 --> 00:02:00.919
In this case, you would first calculate

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.469
the cluster centroids and then you would measure

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.784
the distance between each centroid and each point.

00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:10.875
A large distance might indicate an outlier.

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:15.740
Scikit-learn also includes various outlier detection algorithms,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.460
and I'll provide a link below.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.640
Next, you'll get some practice identifying outliers.
