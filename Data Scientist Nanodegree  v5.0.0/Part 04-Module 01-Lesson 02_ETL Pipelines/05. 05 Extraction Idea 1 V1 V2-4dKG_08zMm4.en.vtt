00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.885
As a reminder, the first part of the ETL pipeline is called extraction,

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:13.844
which refers to pulling and loading data from different sources.

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:20.179
You might find yourself working with data from all types of sources like CSV files, JSON,

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.120
web pages, or even plaint ext files,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.105
or you might need to pull data from databases like SQLite or Postgres.

00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:30.094
In this part of the lesson,

00:00:30.094 --> 00:00:34.304
you'll use Python to read in data from a handful of these different formats.

00:00:34.304 --> 00:00:36.539
You'll be working with a few different packages,

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.210
including pandas and requests.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.439
Let's get started.
