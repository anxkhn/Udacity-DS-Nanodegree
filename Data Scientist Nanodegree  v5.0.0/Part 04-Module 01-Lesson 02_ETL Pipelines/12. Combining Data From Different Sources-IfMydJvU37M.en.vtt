00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:07.529
In the extraction part of the lesson,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.323
you learned that data comes in all different formats and sizes.

00:00:11.323 --> 00:00:16.750
Oftentimes you want to combine part of one data set with part of another data set.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.910
These data sets might be in different formats like a CSV file and JSON file.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.425
Let's say you have a CSV file that has three columns country,

00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:30.160
gross domestic product, and year.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.365
You also have a JSON file containing country name, year, and population.

00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:42.079
You want to visualize changes over time in gross domestic product per capita.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.799
Per capita means you'll need to divide the gross domestic product by the population.

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:50.809
However, you can't merge JSON data and

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.734
a CSV file together without first transforming the data.

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:56.604
In this particular case,

00:00:56.604 --> 00:00:59.029
it will probably be easiest to transform

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.630
the JSON data so that it looked more like the CSV file,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.370
then you could perform a join using the country name.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.250
There isn't a hard and fast rule for how to combine data sets together.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.409
Every data set will be different both in terms of formatting and

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.244
content which means the processes for combining the data will be different.

00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:23.755
In the next part of the lesson,

00:01:23.754 --> 00:01:27.879
you'll find an exercise for combining data from different sources.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.379
Python's pandas package will be

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:34.894
a huge help and I'm assuming that you already know how to use pandas.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:38.825
If you're unfamiliar with pandas or feeling a bit rusty,

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:41.945
I've provided a few learning resources below the video.

00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:43.719
So, let's get coding.
