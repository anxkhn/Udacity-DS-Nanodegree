00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.940
The process of filling in missing values is called imputation.

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:15.399
Let's go through a few ways to impute data and then you'll get some coding practice.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.655
One option is to fill in the missing value using the mean.

00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:24.160
For instance, if you're looking at the costs of the World Bank projects,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.230
some of the data is missing.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.890
You could take the mean value of all projects and use that to fill in empty cells.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.960
You could get even more specific grouping by

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.795
country and then calculating the mean for each country.

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:42.745
Then you'd fill in missing values based on the results.

00:00:42.744 --> 00:00:46.214
The median or mode might work as well.

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:51.400
Now you don't have to delete entire rows or columns of data.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.489
Another common method especially for

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.640
ordered or time series data is to use Forward Fill or Backward Fill.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.750
With both of these methods you could use neighboring cells to fill in the data,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.730
but this technique really only works if the data is ordered by time.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.195
So, the first step is to double check that your data is sorted by a timestamp.

00:01:16.194 --> 00:01:22.704
With Forward Fill, values are pushed forward down to replace any empty values.

00:01:22.704 --> 00:01:25.155
Backward Fill does the opposite,

00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:28.320
values move up to fill in empty values.

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:31.339
In other words, you're either filling in empty cells with

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.704
the previous value or the following value.

00:01:34.704 --> 00:01:37.984
There's no hard and fast rule to follow.

00:01:37.984 --> 00:01:42.349
Filling in missing values can be somewhat of an art and you'll need to

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:47.559
test how different strategies affect the results of your Machine Learning models.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.454
Now that you've seen a few ways to deal with missing data,

00:01:51.454 --> 00:01:53.480
let's get some practice.
