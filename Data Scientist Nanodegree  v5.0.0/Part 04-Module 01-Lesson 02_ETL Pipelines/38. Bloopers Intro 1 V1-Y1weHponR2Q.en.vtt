00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
All right.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.474
You've made it through transformation, congratulations.

00:00:05.474 --> 00:00:10.274
I know it's a lot of material to get through and to reward you, for sticking around.

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:16.990
I want to share a few bloopers that I haven't shown any other Nanodegree student before.

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:20.279
Usually, filming these videos goes pretty well,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.130
but there are definitely a few outlier takes.

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:28.399
Making courses like these, is really,

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:34.759
really hard, and there are always hiccups along the way. Enjoy.

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:36.625
Camera roll.

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:38.420
Imputing data.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.510
Missing data take two.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:48.090
One option is to fill in the missing value using the mean. Did I just say that?

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.664
Grade Search is a method that automates the process of testing different values.

00:00:55.664 --> 00:00:58.700
To find the company. Okay, restart.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.850
Values are pushed forward down.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.219
I feel like something's missing.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.745
Backwards [inaudible] because I didn't explained forward.

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:09.020
So, why would I just. Something happen.

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:12.054
A leaking knowledge from your tests are.

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:15.460
I mean this ain't just our training, is that invalidation.

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:21.394
Great work. You successively. It's very hard work.

00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:25.859
All right Energy. Smiles and energies and unicorns.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.090
He look so happy. I can't help it.
