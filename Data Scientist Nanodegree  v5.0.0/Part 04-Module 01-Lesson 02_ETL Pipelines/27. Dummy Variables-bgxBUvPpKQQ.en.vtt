00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.414
If you plan to use categorical variables with linear regression,

00:00:09.414 --> 00:00:12.189
oftentimes you should convert those variables into

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:15.489
a set of numbers called dummy variables.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.480
For instance, the World Bank Project data contains

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.495
the total amount of money associated with each project.

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:26.785
You want to use a linear regression model to predict

00:00:26.785 --> 00:00:30.353
how much money a new project proposal will receive.

00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:34.939
You could use the project theme as one of your model features.

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:40.894
Say that there are only five themes: agriculture, roads, banking,

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:47.800
retail, and government, and each project is only associated with one theme.

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:51.939
You'll have to convert the theme categories in the numbers.

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:55.229
For each category, you'll create a new feature,

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.434
filling in a one if the row contains that value,

00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:01.955
or a zero if it doesn't contain that value.

00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:05.170
Agriculture will become one feature,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.340
roads another feature, banking another, and finally retail.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.030
You only need four features not five.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.590
If agriculture, roads, banking,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.969
and retail are all zero,

00:01:20.968 --> 00:01:25.780
then you have enough information to know that government is equal to one.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.625
In this example, the first row would be

00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:36.864
1,0,0,0 to indicate that row one has an agriculture value.

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:43.848
Row two would be 0,0,1,0 to indicate that the project covers retail.

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:49.424
The third row would be 0,0,0,0 to represent government.

00:01:49.424 --> 00:01:52.879
Next, you'll practice creating dummy variables.
