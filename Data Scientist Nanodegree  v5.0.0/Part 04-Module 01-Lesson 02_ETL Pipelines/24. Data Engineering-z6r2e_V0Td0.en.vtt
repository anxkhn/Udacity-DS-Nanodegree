00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
Yeah, actually SQL is one of the most important basic skills that one should learn,

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.769
but it's not a very difficult language to learn.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.019
I think many people picked up the skill on the job,

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.884
but it's definitely one of the most important skills to have.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:23.910
I can't think of a day in the past few years that I have not written a SQL query.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.449
How complex are those?

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.769
Are those are just like select from where so you have

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.329
giant subqueries that you run on a regular basis?

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.809
Do you think about efficiency when you write those?

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.350
Yeah, It depends. I think when you're doing some ad hoc analysis,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.265
you don't really care too much.

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:42.840
We just write a query that you need to answer your questions,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.130
so it's more question-driven.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.335
But there are times where you actually have to build out a ETL job,

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:54.410
extract, transform, load, it's kind

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.964
of the jargon that we use for building data pipelines.

00:00:56.965 --> 00:00:58.400
When you're building out data pipelines,

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.739
you need to be a little bit more careful and

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.520
then you need to be a little bit more structured and think about,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.240
if you can see like are you doing the right joint,

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:08.339
should you put the bigger table on the left,

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.695
and depending on the language, it's actually different.

00:01:10.694 --> 00:01:15.209
So, all those things are important,

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:18.804
but I wouldn't say that something that I constantly keep in mind.

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:20.515
You have a question,

00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:22.405
you try to get an answer,

00:01:22.405 --> 00:01:27.079
but it does sound like maybe you are the person often optimizing those things.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.599
It's not like some other team member that does that.

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:32.409
You have like data engineers who focus on that or

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.564
are those skills that you use as a data scientist in your regular job?

00:01:35.564 --> 00:01:37.054
Yeah, that's a good question.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:42.085
Actually, I think all my knowledge are requiring a per need phases,

00:01:42.084 --> 00:01:45.469
but then because I do a lot of data engineering work.

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.679
I learned a ton from people who are much better than I am,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.020
and so over time I got better at this.

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:56.390
So, what do you think falls into like maybe skills that you've

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.409
picked up from data engineers that you're

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.920
really glad that you have now in you're day-to-day work?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.189
Yeah. That's a great topic and a great question.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.514
Because I remember a few years ago,

00:02:08.514 --> 00:02:11.599
I was asking myself the same question because I wanted to learn more about

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.289
data engineering and I was like searching online I couldn't find anything useful.

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:19.969
After joining Airbnb, I work a lot on their engineering project

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:25.060
with their engineers and there are a few things that I think are quite important.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:33.348
So, the first thing would be to have a basic understanding of data modeling,

00:02:33.348 --> 00:02:38.905
and so there are concepts such as how do you design a data warehouse,

00:02:38.905 --> 00:02:40.925
data tables using star schema.

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:47.120
So, the notion of a fact table or dimension table and how wide

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.300
these two things are generally different behind how they can

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.765
be combined into building your data warehouse.

00:02:53.764 --> 00:02:58.919
Another concept is this notion of data backfilling.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.159
So, when you're building out a ETL pipeline,

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.254
most likely it's going to be automated job that will

00:03:05.254 --> 00:03:08.525
compute your metrics forward in time.

00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:14.460
But then sometimes you want to be able to analyze historical data, historical trends.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.030
For those use cases there,

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.849
you actually have to retroactively recompute metrics or history.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.000
So, the concept of data backfilling is also very,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.080
very important, it's also very time-consuming.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.660
So, knowing how to do proper backfilling and then monitor

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.829
the progress of your backfill jobs is something that I think very common,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.280
very important but rarely taught in school.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:49.130
The last thing I think is just working knowledge of building out ETL pipelines.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.520
For that, it really depends.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.935
At Airbnb, we use airflow which is an open source project that is very useful.

00:03:57.935 --> 00:04:03.485
Just knowing how to not just write a ad hoc script but how do you

00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:09.685
incorporate your queries into an ETL job that will be executed every day,

00:04:09.685 --> 00:04:13.715
I think that's a very valuable skill especially for data scientists.

00:04:13.715 --> 00:04:18.875
It will help and unblock your work because you

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:21.079
don't have to wait for data engineers to write

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.099
the ETL for you so they can consume the data, you can just do everything.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.080
For sure.
