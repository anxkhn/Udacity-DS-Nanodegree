00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.509
Great job getting through all of the transformation exercises.

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.629
I know there was a lot of information and a lot of exercises to go through,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.440
but I also want to remind you that a lot of a data scientists

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.820
work is transforming data and getting the data ready for analysis.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.370
So, this is a lot of good practice.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.255
You're almost at the end of the lesson.

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:29.814
In this next part, you'll practice loading data into different formats like CSV,

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:32.679
JSON, and into a database.

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:37.490
The entire exercise is contained in just this one notebook.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.670
If you want an extra challenge,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.789
you'll find a challenge exercise at the end of the notebook that

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.710
involves creating a few more sequel tables than in the other exercises.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.160
Again, there's an answer file for this exercise.

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.719
If you go to file,

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.195
open, and then click on the solution file.

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:03.530
You'll also notice as well that in the beginning of

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.180
this exercise all of the data is loaded and transformed for you.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.580
The transformations are things that you practiced earlier in the lesson.

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.534
So, I did this for you so that you wouldn't have to repeat the same exercise over again.

00:01:18.534 --> 00:01:23.079
That way, you can focus your time on the load portion of the ETL pipeline,

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.069
rather than repeating what you've already done.
