00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.969
Great work. You've successfully extracted data from a variety of sources,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.640
that's the first part of an ETL pipeline.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.865
Now, you'll practice transforming data.

00:00:16.864 --> 00:00:19.469
What does transform really mean?

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:21.364
In the context of data science,

00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:26.479
transformation usually involves getting data ready for a machine learning algorithm.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.789
For instance, you'll often work with data coming from more than one source.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.979
You might need to pull some data from a CSV file,

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:36.945
other data from a SQL database,

00:00:36.945 --> 00:00:39.905
and then combine those two datasets together,

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:42.844
or perhaps you want to clean the data,

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:44.795
or engineer new features.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:50.005
Hence, you're transforming the original datasets to create a new dataset.

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:51.755
In this part of the lesson,

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:54.770
you'll practice many data transformation techniques

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.315
such as combining data from different sources,

00:00:57.314 --> 00:01:01.114
cleaning data, and working with different data encodings.

00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:05.469
You'll also see how to search for and remove duplicate data rows,

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:08.424
create dummy variables, remove outliers,

00:01:08.424 --> 00:01:12.420
normalize data, and engineer new features.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.870
You might be thinking that there are a lot of topics to cover and you're right.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.515
A survey by one of our industry partners,

00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:23.739
Figure Eight found that data scientists spend

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:28.530
80 percent of their time gathering and transforming data.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.474
We have a lot to get through,

00:01:30.474 --> 00:01:32.439
so let's get right to it.
