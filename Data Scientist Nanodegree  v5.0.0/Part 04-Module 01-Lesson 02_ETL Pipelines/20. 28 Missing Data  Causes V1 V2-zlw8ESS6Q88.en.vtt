00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.435
A dataset might be missing data for a number of reasons.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:14.620
Some datasets were created manually by a human sitting at a keyboard typing.

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.369
You can imagine how easy it would be to make

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.519
a mistake or forget to input a piece of data.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.699
Even when data gets automatically recorded,

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.175
you could end up with missing values.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:30.660
Consider a weather station that measures the air temperature, pressure,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.795
and wind speed on top of a building,

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:36.929
and then sends the measurements to a database every two seconds.

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:41.030
The sensor might malfunction and skip a measurement.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.674
The data might be lost or corrupted in transmission,

00:00:45.674 --> 00:00:50.224
and sometimes a missing value actually should be missing.

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:55.670
This happens especially with text or categorical variables, for example,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.495
each project entry in the World Bank Project dataset has

00:00:59.494 --> 00:01:04.704
five variables representing the theme or purpose of the project.

00:01:04.704 --> 00:01:09.414
These variables are labeled theme 1 through theme 5.

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:14.205
Some projects might have values for all five theme variables,

00:01:14.204 --> 00:01:18.435
other projects might only encompass one theme.

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:24.935
This is a case where the theme 2 through 5 variables should be empty.

00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:27.560
To run a machine learning algorithm,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.409
you can't have missing values in your dataset.

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.119
So, next we'll talk about your options when your dataset is missing values.
