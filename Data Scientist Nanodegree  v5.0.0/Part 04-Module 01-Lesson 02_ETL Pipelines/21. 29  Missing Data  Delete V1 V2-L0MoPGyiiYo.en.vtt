00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.224
If you're missing data,

00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:08.824
you really only have two options,

00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:10.529
you can delete data,

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.003
or you can fill in the missing values.

00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:16.410
Here's what I mean when I say delete data.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.839
Take a look at this DataFrame,

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.795
most of the columns or features,

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:23.675
if we're talking about machine learning,

00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:27.300
are completely filled with data except for this one here,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.324
this one has quite a lot of missing values,

00:00:30.324 --> 00:00:34.019
it's probably best to delete this column from you analysis

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.145
unless you can somehow find the missing values from another source.

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:40.450
What about this row over here?

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.810
This row is also missing quite a lot of values,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.450
if you feel like it won't affect your analysis,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.234
you could remove this row from the data,

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:51.670
deleting data however, isn't

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.965
your only option you can also try to fill in those missing values.

00:00:55.965 --> 00:01:00.200
Next, let's talk about some of these techniques.
