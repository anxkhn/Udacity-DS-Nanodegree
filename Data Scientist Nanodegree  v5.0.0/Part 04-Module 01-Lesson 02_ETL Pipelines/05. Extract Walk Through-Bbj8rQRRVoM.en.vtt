00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.754
In the next part of the lesson,

00:00:01.754 --> 00:00:05.639
you'll be working on the extract part of an ETL pipeline.

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:09.765
You will be extracting data from different sources like CSV files,

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:13.320
JSON files, XML, and SQL databases.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.810
I'm just going to give you a brief overview about how

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.350
this section is organized and what you can expect?

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.740
You'll notice in general,

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.863
this lesson isn't too heavy on theory,

00:00:22.864 --> 00:00:27.585
it's mostly practical exercises so that you gain practice moving,

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:30.005
cleaning, and preparing data.

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:32.475
You'll see that whenever there's an exercise,

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:34.859
it's marked here on the left as an exercise.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:39.229
All of the exercises are contained in Jupyter Notebooks.

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:41.244
When you open an exercise,

00:00:41.244 --> 00:00:44.449
the notebook opens automatically in the workspace.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.290
To complete the exercise,

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.500
read through the notebooks and follow the instructions.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.164
For some code cells,

00:00:51.164 --> 00:00:52.909
you only need to run them,

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:54.889
but for other code cells,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.285
there's going to be a to do with instructions.

00:00:57.284 --> 00:00:58.934
So, whenever you see a to do,

00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:01.460
that means you have some code to write.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.400
I want to call your attention to the fact that,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.820
all of these exercises also have solutions.

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:11.399
If you click on the Jupyter icon up here,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.560
and then you find the file with the exercise you're currently working on,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.674
which in this case is one CSV exercise.

00:01:18.674 --> 00:01:20.194
Then click and go inside,

00:01:20.194 --> 00:01:21.339
you can click here,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.125
and open a solution file.

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:25.245
So, going back one level,

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:29.025
all of these files have the exercises in them in Jupyter Notebooks,

00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:34.670
and they also have all of the solutions.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.695
Going here to this exercise on JSON, and XML,

00:01:38.694 --> 00:01:46.009
you'll see at the bottom that I've marked a section as a challenge, way down here.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.079
So, what I mean by that,

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.599
is that this part is more challenging and

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:54.500
also time-consuming than other parts of the exercise.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.250
I always put them as the very last thing at the bottom of an exercise.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.954
If I've marked something as a challenge,

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:05.099
it means, I think you'll get something out of solving it,

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.439
but it's not essential for understanding the lesson material or for

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:14.710
getting through the final project at the end of this course.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.590
So, start working on this extract section and then when you get down to transform here,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.530
I'll give another overview about that section as well.
