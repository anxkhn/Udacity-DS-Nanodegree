00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.695
In this next section,

00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:06.089
you'll start working on the transformation part of a data pipeline.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.000
This transformation section is relatively

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.065
long because there are many different ways to transform data.

00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:15.119
Like in the extract section,

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.754
each exercises in a Jupyter notebook.

00:00:17.754 --> 00:00:23.614
You'll see that many exercises have a challenge problem at the end.

00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:28.458
Again, these are problems that I think are worth doing,

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:30.814
but they're really optional and you don't have to do them

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:33.304
in order to get through the lesson and

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:38.469
understand the material as well as doing the project at the end of the course.

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.159
I also want to emphasize that each notebook has an answer file which you can find

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.709
by clicking here on the Jupyter icon or going to file and then open,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.929
and then there will be a solution here.
