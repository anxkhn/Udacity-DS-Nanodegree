00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
This lesson is divided into three parts.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.334
You have the extract part which starts here,

00:00:06.334 --> 00:00:09.330
and then you have transform,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.788
and then finally here at the bottom you have

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:21.390
load and then that is followed by an exercise that puts ETL altogether.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.714
Throughout the lesson, you'll be working through

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:26.730
exercises that use data from the World Bank.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.015
Although, you won't be running any machine learning algorithms, in this lesson,

00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:34.975
you'll be preparing data for a task such as linear regression,

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:38.649
this is the World Bank's project website.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.769
The World Bank has quite a bit of data that you can download.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.500
In this lesson, you'll work with data from

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.115
the World Bank projects database and the World Bank indicators database.

00:00:51.115 --> 00:00:55.609
For example, each World Bank Project has a cost associated with

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.259
it as well as other data like the project title and project theme.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:04.265
The indicator data with the World Bank has

00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:09.430
socio-demographic information and financial data about countries around the world.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.070
Say, if you're going to try to predict the cost of a World Bank project,

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:19.204
you might want to see if the socio-demographic or financial country data

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:20.765
made good features.

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:24.890
You'd have to combine data together from the projects dataset as

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.379
well as this socio demographic data.

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:33.109
Again, you won't actually be trying to make these predictions.

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:35.359
Instead, you'll be putting the data through

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.959
an ETL pipeline to get the data ready for analysis.

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:43.044
Let me just give you a better overview of where this data comes from.

00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:46.835
So back here, this website has information

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:50.750
about all of the projects that the World Bank finances.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.489
If you scroll down here,

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:58.189
and go to use our data and click and then you go to data and resources,

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.149
you can download the projects data in different formats.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.080
For example, they have a project's API and they also have a CSV file.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.620
So, what I did for this lesson was I

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.375
downloaded the CSV file and used it in the classroom.

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:16.099
You're not going to actually have to download data from

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.905
this website because I've already done it and set it up for you.

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:25.675
So, the World Bank has another data repository for country indicator data.

00:02:25.675 --> 00:02:28.740
Indicators are things like GDP,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.400
percent of a population that is rural,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.080
and other demographic and economic information.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.585
To give an example,

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:39.635
you'll be working with GDP data.

00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:43.560
You can go here to the search bar and put in GDP,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.030
and then it says GP current US dollar and then

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.655
there are bunch of other ways that they measure GDP.

00:02:50.655 --> 00:02:53.000
So, I'm going to click here on top.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.835
Then there's a graphical user interface where you can play around with the data.

00:02:57.835 --> 00:03:02.150
But all I did was go here to the side where it says download and then I would just

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.855
click on whatever format I wanted and download the data.

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:09.409
Again, I've said it all up for you in the classroom

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.379
so you don't actually have to download this data yourself.

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.159
Notice as well, up here in the web URL,

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.840
it says NY, GDP, and KTPCD.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.780
So, that is some sort of abbreviation the World Bank uses to represent GDP.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.344
Going back to the classroom,

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:36.960
the exercises are marked here on the left as an exercise.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.560
So for example, if you clicked on extract

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.979
here that would be just information there might be text in

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:47.629
a video and then you'll click on exercise CSV which will open

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.919
an exercise with a Jupiter notebook and then you can start working.

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.719
So, that's where the data comes from for this lesson and that's

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:01.199
how all of the exercises are organized.
