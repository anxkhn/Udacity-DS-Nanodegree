00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:06.869
You've found some outliers.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.359
Now, what do you do with them?

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:14.039
Let's go back to looking at a two-dimensional graph that contains an outlier.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.449
Clearly, this point is far away from the rest of the data,

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.579
and if you were to draw a trend line,

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.234
the outlier is pulling the trend line up.

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:27.405
Removing the data point will give a different trend line.

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:31.160
If you were to use a linear regression model on this data,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.268
you want to make sure that removing the outlier gives you better results.

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:39.695
Ask yourself, does removing the outlier improve the model?

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:45.530
Does your mean squared error or whatever metric you're using decrease on your test set?

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.259
Are you certain that your model does not need to take into

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:51.969
consideration a similar value to what you removed?

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.454
What about this second case?

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.655
This also looks like an outlier,

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:59.840
the data point is far away from the rest of the data.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.590
But does it affect a machine learning model?

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.760
In this case, removing this datapoint hardly changes the trend line,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.410
so it's not actually an outlier.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.679
The point has a large X value,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.505
but then also has a correspondingly large Y value.

00:01:15.504 --> 00:01:21.399
In general, consider how removing datapoints will affect your machine learning models.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.560
If removing an outlier improves the model,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.295
then consider removing extreme isolated data points.

00:01:28.295 --> 00:01:33.870
On the other hand, if removing an extreme value has no or little effect on your results,

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.760
you can leave the point as is.
