00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.719
Data comes in all shapes, formats, and sizes.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.870
It's the data engineer's job to make sure that all of

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.494
this information is accessible and ready for analysis.

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:22.214
One of the major responsibilities of a data engineer is called pipelining.

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:27.589
Pipelining is a generic term for moving data from one place to another place.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.255
For example, you could pipeline data from a database to another database,

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:34.955
or from a text file to a CSV file,

00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:37.429
or text file to a database.

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:42.354
In this lesson, you'll learn about perhaps the most commonly used data pipeline,

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:48.104
which is called ETL, extract, transform, load.

00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:52.804
With ETL pipelines, you extract data from one place,

00:00:52.804 --> 00:00:55.505
transform data into another format,

00:00:55.505 --> 00:01:00.109
and then load the transform data into storage somewhere else.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.575
How is this relevant to your role as a data scientist?

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:08.100
Ideally, data scientist work over at the far end of the pipeline.

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:10.934
After the data is transformed and loaded,

00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:15.540
a data engineer has already set up the data for you to analyze.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.594
In these cases, you'll need to give engineers clear instructions

00:01:19.594 --> 00:01:24.239
about what data you need and what format the data should be in.

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:26.979
However, if you work in a smaller company,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.850
you'll very likely act as both data scientists and data engineer.

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:36.239
This lesson will help you prepare for both of these cases.
