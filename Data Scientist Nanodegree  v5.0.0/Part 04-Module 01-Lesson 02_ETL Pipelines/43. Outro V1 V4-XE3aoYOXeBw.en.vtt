00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
Congrats on all the hard work you've put in.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.289
This lesson contained a lot of information encoding exercises.

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.329
Let's recap what you've learned.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.490
One of the main roles of a data engineer is to prepare data pipelines.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:25.119
Pipelines are used to move data from one place to another place.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.880
You practice writing code for a very specific and common pipeline

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:34.829
called ETL or Extract Transform Load.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.049
You pull data from a source,

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:42.114
transform the data and then load that transformed data into storage.

00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:46.429
With your knowledge of ETL pipelines you can communicate better with

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:52.530
a data engineer explaining exactly what data you need and what the data should look like.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.480
As a data scientist,

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.534
much of your job will involve gathering and cleaning data.

00:00:58.534 --> 00:01:05.509
The extract and transform skills you developed in this lesson will be especially helpful.
