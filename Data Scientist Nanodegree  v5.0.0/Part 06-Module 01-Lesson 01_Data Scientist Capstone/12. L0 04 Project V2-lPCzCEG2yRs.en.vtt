00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.039
Imagine you are working

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:13.570
on the data team for a popular digital music service similar to Spotify or Pandora.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.320
Menus of users stream their favorite songs to your service every day either using

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.170
the free tier that place advertisements between

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.440
the songs or using the premium subscription model,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.580
where they stream music as free but pay a monthly flat rate.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.274
Users can upgrade, downgrade,

00:00:32.274 --> 00:00:34.379
or cancel their service at any time.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.825
So, it's crucial to make sure your users love the service.

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:43.755
Every time a user interacts with the service while they're playing songs, logging out,

00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:46.425
like in a song with a thumbs up, hearing an ad,

00:00:46.424 --> 00:00:49.599
or downgrading their service, it generates data.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.219
All this data contains the key insights for

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.369
keeping your users happy and helping your business thrive.

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:59.269
It's your job on the data team to predict which users are at risk to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.775
churn either downgrading from premium

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:04.855
to free tier or cancelling their service altogether.

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:08.780
If you can accurately identify these users before they leave,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.570
your business can offer them discounts and incentives,

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:14.689
potentially saving your business millions in revenue.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.620
To tackle this project,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.725
we have provided you with a large dataset that contains the events David just described.

00:01:21.724 --> 00:01:23.234
You will need to load,

00:01:23.234 --> 00:01:26.015
explorer, and clean this dataset with Spark.

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:27.709
Based on your explanation,

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:30.559
you will create features and build models with Spark to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.870
predict which users were churn from your digital music service.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.939
This project is all about demonstrating mastery of

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.174
Spark scalable data manipulation and machine learning.

00:01:41.174 --> 00:01:43.039
After completing this project,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.310
you'll have built a useful model with a massive dataset.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.460
You'll be able to apply the same skills with Spark to

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.569
wrangle data and build models in your role as a data scientist.
