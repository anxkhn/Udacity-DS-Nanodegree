00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:11.705
Congratulations on making it to this final part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree program.

00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:14.490
You've learned a great amount up to this point that covers

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.155
so many skills utilized by data scientists in the field.

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:20.040
You started out by learning about

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.309
the Data Science Process and the broad steps that need to be taken to

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:25.579
go from a question of interest all the way to

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.369
conveying findings to an audience and deploying results.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.225
You then learn how to use best practices in software engineering.

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:35.975
You learned how to write effective code and how to test your code.

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:37.625
You also learned how to write

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:42.213
object-oriented programs and deploy web applications using Flask.

00:00:42.213 --> 00:00:46.100
After that, you're introduced to skills and data engineering.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.265
You completed data and machine learning pipelines that could be used to collect,

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:54.270
clean, and organize data for much easier analysis.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.330
Most recently, you developed your skills with two important applications of

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.905
data science techniques: experiment design and recommendation engines.

00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:05.290
Looking at the list of skills covered,

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.720
you should be proud of what you've accomplished up to this point.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.159
Now, it's time for one final challenge before you

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.319
complete the program, the Capstone Project.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.844
There are many ways to complete this project.

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:19.060
You might check out one of

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.454
our curated options and see if one of them catches your interest.

00:01:22.454 --> 00:01:26.310
Some of these topics have been provided by hiring partners,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.469
or you can come up with your own study topic.

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.120
If there's a particular field that you're interested in,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.740
this is your opportunity to get

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:38.504
some hands-on experience by exploring a data project of your own creation.

00:01:38.504 --> 00:01:40.599
Once you've selected a topic,

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.829
you will explore that topic by applying

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.640
the key skills in the data science process that you've learned in this program.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.390
The output will demonstrate your proficiency with data science skills to

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.665
others and will be a valuable addition to your portfolio.

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:56.605
Whatever choice you make,

00:01:56.605 --> 00:01:58.995
you're going to end up with something great.

00:01:58.995 --> 00:02:02.579
I hope that you're eager to take on the final task of this program.

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.269
All of us here are excited to see you at the finish line.
