00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
We're actually partnering with IBM to build

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.245
this really great project for everyone to sort of utilize in the classroom.

00:00:06.245 --> 00:00:09.750
Can you give us a little insight into the platform that they'll

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.960
be using and sort of the data that they'll be getting out of it?

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.455
Right. Yeah, so the project is cool.

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:16.920
I like the project,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.210
I thought it was a great idea when we got started working on it. So what is the project?

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.730
Well on Watson studio,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.670
an important component as we discussed was is the community and

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.585
the community is this collaborative ecosystem of a curated datasets,

00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:34.469
articles, notebooks or other kinds

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.140
of assets that are out there in the world of data science,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.399
machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.384
Our users on the platform interact with these assets.

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:48.119
So what the students are building and what we've built is

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:52.489
a recommendation system for these assets in the community.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.060
So one thing is that what we do is we go out there ourselves

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.765
and we curate also with models that we developed here at IBM,

00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:04.515
all this kind of all these assets that are out there.

00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:09.079
What the students will be doing is building in that part where it makes it personal for

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:10.909
an individual user and providing

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.659
that personalized recommendation experience with a web app.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.479
Cool. So it sounds like this is actually something that isn't

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.750
on your platform but could be really useful to people on your plan.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.224
Yeah, that's right.

00:01:22.224 --> 00:01:26.030
Now that's very cool. So, students will be working on a recommendation system to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.125
sort of like personalize recommendations for people who are already in the community?

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:35.000
That's right. Yes, so the data that they'll have is anonymized data of

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.939
the interactions between all of the different kinds of articles and

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.989
datasets and that sort of thing we have in the community and our users.

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:45.419
So there's that communication between what they're actually doing on the platform,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.769
interacting with those assets,

00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:50.849
and all of that is actually part of the data that they'll take advantage of.

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:52.289
So that's pretty exciting I think.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.920
Yeah, it sounds like a really cool project.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.990
It also sounds like so students will be able to sort of tackle

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:03.929
this recommendation system however they might want

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.890
to which could be like looking at how users are connected,

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.469
how articles are connected,

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.234
how different types of medium are connected,

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:15.255
and there's like lots of different ways that they could go about creating a solution.

00:02:15.254 --> 00:02:16.259
Yeah.

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:17.949
Very cool.
