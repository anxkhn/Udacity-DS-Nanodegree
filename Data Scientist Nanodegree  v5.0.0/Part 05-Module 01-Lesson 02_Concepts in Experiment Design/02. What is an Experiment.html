  <h2 id="types-of-study">Types of Study</h2>
<p>There are many ways in which data can be collected in order to test or<br />
understand the relationship between two variables of interest. These methods<br />
can be put into three main bins, based on the amount of control that you hold<br />
over the variables in play:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a lot of control over features, then you have an <strong>experiment</strong>.</li>
<li>If you have no control over the features, then you have an <strong>observational study</strong>.</li>
<li>If you have some control, then you have a <strong>quasi-experiment</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the experiment is the main focus of this course, it's also useful to know<br />
about the other types of study so that you can use them in effective ways, <br />
especially if an experiment cannot be run.</p>
<h3 id="experiments">Experiments</h3>
<p>In the social and medical sciences, an experiment is defined by comparing <br />
outcomes between two or more groups, and ensuring equivalence between the <br />
compared groups <em>except</em> for the manipulation that we want to test. Our <br />
interest in an experiment is to see if a change in one feature has an effect in <br />
the value of a second feature, like seeing if changing the layout of a button <br />
on a website <em>causes</em> more visitors to click on it. Having multiple groups is <br />
necessary in order to compare the outcome for when we apply the manipulation to <br />
when we do not (e.g. old vs. new website layout), or to compare different <br />
levels of manipulation (e.g. drug dosages). We also need equivalence between <br />
groups so that we can be as sure as possible that the differences in the <br />
outcomes were only due to the difference in our manipulated feature.</p>
<p>Equivalence between groups is typically carried out through some kind of<br />
randomization procedure. A <strong>unit of analysis</strong> is the entity under study,<br />
like a page view or a user in a web experiment. If we randomly assign our units<br />
of analysis to each group, then on the whole, we should expect the feature<br />
distributions between groups to be about the same. This theoretically isolates<br />
the changes in the outcome to the changes in our manipulated feature. Of course,<br />
we can always dig deeper afterwards to see if certain other features worked in<br />
tandem with, or against, our manipulation.</p>
<h3 id="observational-studies">Observational Studies</h3>
<p>In an experiment, we exert a lot of control on a system in order to narrow down <br />
the changes in our system from one source to one output. Observational studies, <br />
on the other hand, are defined by a lack of control. Observational studies are <br />
also known as naturalistic or correlational studies. In an observational study, <br />
no control is exerted on the variables of interest, perhaps due to ethical <br />
concerns or a lack of power to enact the manipulation. This often comes up in <br />
medical studies. For example, if we want to look at the effects of smoking on <br />
health, the potential risks make it unethical to force people into smoking <br />
behaviors. Instead, we need to rely on existing data or groups to make our <br />
determinations.</p>
<p>We typically cannot infer causality in an observational study due to our lack <br />
of control over the variables. Any relationship observed between variables may <br />
be due to unobserved features, or the direction of causality might be uncertain. <br />
(We'll discuss this more later in the lesson.) But simply because an <br />
observational study does not imply causation does not mean that it is not <br />
useful. An interesting relationship might be the spark needed to perform <br />
additional studies or to collect more data. These studies can help strengthen <br />
the understanding of the relationship we're interested in by ruling out more <br />
and more alternative hypotheses.</p>
<h3 id="quasi-experiments">Quasi-Experiments</h3>
<p>In between the observational study and the experiment is the quasi-experiment. <br />
This is where some, but not all, of the control requirements of a true <br />
experiment are met. For example, rolling out a new website interface to all <br />
users to see how much time they spend on it might be considered a <br />
quasi-experiment. While the manipulation is controlled by the experimenter, <br />
there aren't multiple groups to compare. The experimenter can still use the <br />
behavior of the population pre-change and compare that to behaviors post-change, <br />
to make judgment on the effects of the change. However, there is the <br />
possibility that there are other effects outside of the manipulation that <br />
caused the observed changes in behavior. For the example earlier in this <br />
paragraph, it might be that users would have naturally gravitated to higher <br />
usage rates, regardless of the website interface.</p>
<p>As another example, we might have two different groups upon which to make a <br />
comparison of outcomes, but the original groups themselves might not be <br />
equivalent. A classic example of this is if a researcher wants to test some new <br />
supplemental materials for a high school course. If they select two different <br />
schools, one with the new materials and one without, we have a quasi-experiment <br />
since the differing qualities of students or teachers at those schools might <br />
have an effect on the outcomes. Ideally, we'd like to match the two schools <br />
before the test as closely as possible, but we can't call it a true experiment <br />
since the assignment of student to school can't be considered random.</p>
<p>While a quasi-experiment may not have the same strength of causality inference <br />
as a true experiment, the results can still provide a strong amount of <br />
evidence for the relationship being investigated. This is especially true if <br />
some kind of matching is performed to identify similar units or groups. Another <br />
benefit of quasi-experimental designs is that the relaxation of requirements <br />
makes the quasi-experiment more flexible and easier to set up.</p>
