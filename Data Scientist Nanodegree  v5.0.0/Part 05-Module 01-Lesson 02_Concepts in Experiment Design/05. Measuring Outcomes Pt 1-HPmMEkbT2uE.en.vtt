00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.380
If you want to design an effective study,

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.180
you need to clearly separate the goal of

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.199
your study from how you will measure its success.

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.449
For example, a video streaming site might have

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.099
the goal of improving its recommendation engines performance.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.955
But what does that actually mean for the engine to show good performance?

00:00:24.954 --> 00:00:28.574
There's a lot of ways you could consider measuring this.

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:34.075
One way is through the amount of time that each user spends watching videos.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:39.560
Another might be to check the ranking of the video that the user clicks on first,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.370
or perhaps it makes sense to record the number of

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:45.879
times that the user performs a search with the engine.
