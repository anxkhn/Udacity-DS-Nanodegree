00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.234
Let's say that you're working for a government office that's

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:12.269
trying to understand the issues facing the residents of the region.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.269
It would be way too much effort to get feedback from every single person.

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:19.939
In cases like this where you have more of

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.635
people available than you can include in your study,

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:27.300
it's good to know about performing sampling as part of your design.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.670
One way that we could sample from the population is just to randomly pull

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.170
people out of the full population until we get a 1000 participants.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.829
Everyone has an equal chance of being selected so we should

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.189
expect the sample to be representative of the population as a whole.

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:48.214
This kind of sampling is called simple random sampling

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:53.330
and is what most people think of when random sampling is used on its own.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.924
But what if we have a particular population characteristics that we're interested in?

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:02.424
Let's say that there are three subdivisions for our region;

00:01:02.424 --> 00:01:05.390
a dense urban area with a lot of people here,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.250
a moderately dense suburban area here,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.515
and a low density of rural area here.

00:01:11.515 --> 00:01:13.790
We might want to guarantee that we get

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.665
a representative opinion from folks living in the rural area.

00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:20.005
But with a simple random sample,

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:24.390
we might end up undersampling from that area just by chance.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.484
This is undesirable if our goal is to understand

00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:30.540
each region separately as well as the whole.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.440
So, as an alternative sampling approach,

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.259
we could take a specified sample from each subdivision of the population.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.185
If we need a thousand people,

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:43.030
and 50 percent of people are in the urban region,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.504
30 percent in the suburban region,

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:48.149
and 20 percent in the rural region,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.010
then we would sample 500 people from the urban region,

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.650
300 from the suburban region and 200 from the rural region.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.650
This would guarantee that we get a desired level of knowledge

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.570
from each region rather than leave the variability to chance.

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.699
Dividing your population into distinct subgroups and then sampling from each of

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:15.759
them is called stratified random sampling.
