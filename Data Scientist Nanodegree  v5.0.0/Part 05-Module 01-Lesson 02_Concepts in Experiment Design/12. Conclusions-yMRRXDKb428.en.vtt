00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.800
Congratulations on making it to the end of the lesson.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.240
In this lesson, we've covered a very broad selection of

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.949
topics related to the design of studies and experiments.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.890
You learned about the spectrum of control from observational study to

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.250
experiment and you learned different ways of setting up an experiment.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.460
You learned about separating the goals of

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.630
a study from the metrics used to measure its success.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:32.640
You also learned about potential pitfalls in the design of

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.465
a study from dimensions like validity,

00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:38.285
bias and confounding variables.

00:00:38.284 --> 00:00:43.169
Finally, you learned about the role of ethics in experimental design.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.700
There is a lot to consider when it comes to making sure that

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.135
your designs actually accomplish their designated goals.

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:53.824
So, don't be discouraged if it hasn't all settled in.

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:56.900
I encourage you to check out the reference sheet in

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.390
the resources section for a summary of topics

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.575
to help guide your own experimental designs.

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:05.240
In the next lesson, we'll discuss some of

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.719
the statistical and technical issues that can arise when conducting experiments.

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.069
This will be a vital complement to the conceptual foundations

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:17.459
that you've learned in this lesson. See you there.
