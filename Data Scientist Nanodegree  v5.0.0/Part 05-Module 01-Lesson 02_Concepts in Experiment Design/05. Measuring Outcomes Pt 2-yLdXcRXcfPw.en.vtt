00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.220
Watch time, video ranking,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.625
and number of search queries are all examples of evaluation metrics.

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:17.115
All of them provide an objective way of measuring the outcome we hope to see.

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:21.229
While the idea of improving performance on its own is vague,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.704
an evaluation metric makes success concrete and measurable.

00:00:25.704 --> 00:00:31.669
For watch time, success comes from user staying on the site for longer periods of time.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.320
For video ranking, we want to see the average ranking of selected videos go up,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.719
and if users make more searches,

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.320
perhaps that's a way of declaring the recommendation engines effectiveness.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.384
But each of the proposed evaluation metrics also has its possible negative side.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:54.780
If we measure success by the amount of time users spend watching videos,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.820
the recommendation engine could prefer recommending longer videos,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.814
causing video creators to submit videos with padded lengths.

00:01:02.814 --> 00:01:05.269
For the video ranking metric,

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.670
a misguided engine might deliberately include

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.144
less relevant videos lower in the ranking to emphasize the higher rank videos.

00:01:13.144 --> 00:01:18.754
The number of search queries metric probably has the biggest potential downside.

00:01:18.754 --> 00:01:21.185
While it might be that users that make

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:24.290
more searches have increased engagement with the site,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.020
it might also indicate that the engine is having

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:30.920
a hard time serving videos that users really want.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.530
If users leave the site due to this,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.239
then this could have a detrimental long-term effect.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.730
This points to why it's important to consider

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.424
the study goals separately from the evaluation metrics.

00:01:44.424 --> 00:01:49.510
First, we want to make sure that our metrics are aligned with the goals that we've set.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.210
Observing a change in the metric isn't the main point of a study;

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:58.659
it's the implications of that change with regards to the study goals that really matters.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.295
Second, considering the goal on its own can provide a central purpose to your study.

00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:07.390
If you don't have a good reason for running an experiment,

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.560
then it might end up being a waste of time and resources.
