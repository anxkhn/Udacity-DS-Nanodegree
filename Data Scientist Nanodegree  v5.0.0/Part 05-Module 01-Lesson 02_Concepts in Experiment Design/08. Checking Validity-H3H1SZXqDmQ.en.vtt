00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.460
When you explain the outcomes of a study to others,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.425
you want to make sure that they truly say what you truly mean.

00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:16.500
In a single word, you want the outcomes to be valid.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.454
Validity is simply how well your experiment

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:22.634
actually accomplishes what it sets out to perform.

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:27.745
There are three major ways for our experiment to be valid: through construct validity,

00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:31.435
internal validity, and external validity.

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:37.004
First, you want to make sure that your metrics are aligned with your study's goals.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.105
This is called construct validity.

00:00:40.104 --> 00:00:45.319
You've seen an example of a metric with poor construct validity earlier in the lesson.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.814
Recall the proposed metric citing that the number of searches

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:52.625
as an indicator of the goodness of a recommendation engine.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:55.070
Since the metric might be measuring something

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.395
that is not aligned with the engine's quality,

00:00:57.395 --> 00:01:02.140
using it would lower the experiment's construct validity.

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:08.715
Secondly, you want to make sure that claims of causality are supported by the analysis.

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:11.585
This is called internal validity.

00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:16.324
You've also seen aspects of poor internal validity in a previous video.

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:19.549
Poor internal validity can be demonstrated by saying

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.069
that ice cream sales cause an increase in crime rates.

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:28.750
Simply taking the correlation between the two as a causal relationship without accounting

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.724
for other variables like temperature is a sign that internal validity has not been met.

00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:38.414
The third and final branch, external validity,

00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:41.500
is concerned with the ability to generalize the results of

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.930
an experiment to the population at large or to other groups.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.545
This differs from construct validity since in experiment's metric might

00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:55.715
appropriately apply towards a project goal but only towards a narrow group.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:58.480
For example, let's say we tested out

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.180
an alternative instruction method on a group of

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.320
college students and saw a huge improvement in their test scores.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.984
With respect to external validity,

00:02:07.984 --> 00:02:11.794
we need to consider if those results could be generalized to students at

00:02:11.794 --> 00:02:17.559
other colleges or even a wider audience outside of academic institutions.
