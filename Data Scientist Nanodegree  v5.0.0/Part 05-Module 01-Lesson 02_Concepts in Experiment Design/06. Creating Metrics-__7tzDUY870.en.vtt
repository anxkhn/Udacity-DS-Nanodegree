00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:09.149
Let's go back once more to our earlier example where we added

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.669
the quick view overlay to the online store front

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.259
and flesh out the design details with some terminology.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.320
As a reminder, we hypothesized that adding a quick view overlay to

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.324
the product images after a search might increase the total purchases made by users.

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:30.829
One thing that you'll want to do is to describe how a user goes from visiting the site,

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.155
all the way to finishing their purchase.

00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:36.035
Think about how you would buy something from the site.

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:37.879
Starting from the homepage,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.115
you'd put in a product you want into the search bar and get back a list of products.

00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:45.440
After clicking on a product image,

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:48.189
you're taken to the product information page.

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:54.024
Then, you can put the product in your cart and then either keep shopping, or check out.

00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:59.570
This expected path from start to finish is the user funnel.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.590
How does the funnel change when we implement the new overlay?

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.594
For users in experimental or quick view overlay group,

00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:11.844
the funnel adds the summary overlays to the product images.

00:01:11.844 --> 00:01:15.859
Users in that condition can use the quick view overlay to add

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:20.284
products to their cart in addition to the standard product pages.

00:01:20.284 --> 00:01:26.454
Now, we have to decide where in that path to split the users into two groups.

00:01:26.454 --> 00:01:29.929
One way that we could run the experiment is to assign each

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.940
visitor a website cookie as soon as they visit the site.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.829
The cookie sticks around through the session and

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.010
determines which site version the visitor sees.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.775
We can describe this method with the term unit of diversion.

00:01:44.775 --> 00:01:46.570
The unit of diversion,

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.214
in this case the cookie,

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:52.165
is essentially the place where we divide our observations.

00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:55.685
From here, we choose our evaluation metrics.

00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:59.155
Metrics upon which we will compare the two groups.

00:01:59.155 --> 00:02:04.310
These are the values that will tell us if our experiment is a success or not.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.145
Examples of good metrics include the total net amount made per user,

00:02:09.145 --> 00:02:12.945
or just the proportion of visitors who made a purchase in each condition.

00:02:12.944 --> 00:02:15.194
We're not limited to just one metric,

00:02:15.194 --> 00:02:19.775
we could track both of them in case the overlay doesn't change them in the same way.

00:02:19.775 --> 00:02:24.770
We should also track metrics that we expect to not change between groups.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.284
These metrics are useful to verify that our control and experimental groups

00:02:29.284 --> 00:02:34.174
are comparable to one another except for the experimental condition.

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:40.760
The metrics that just check for these equivalences are called invariant metrics.

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:44.194
An example of an invariant metric in this case

00:02:44.194 --> 00:02:47.780
would be the number of cookies generated by each group.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.020
If our randomization is working properly,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.900
then we should expect about the same number of visitors to be assigned to each condition.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.599
We can also count the number of logged in users that get assigned to

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.769
each condition to control for imbalances in historic shopping behavior.
