  <h2 id="creating-metrics">Creating Metrics</h2>
<h3 id="funnels">Funnels</h3>
<p>There are additional concepts and terms that are commonly used for designing<br />
experiments, especially for web-based studies. In a web experiment, you'll<br />
often think of the user <strong>funnel</strong>. A funnel is the flow of steps you expect a<br />
user of your product to take. Typically, the funnel ends at the place where<br />
your main evaluation metric is recorded, and includes a step where your<br />
experimental manipulation can be performed. For example, we might think of the<br />
following steps for someone to purchase a product in an online store:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit the site homepage</li>
<li>Search for a desired product or click on a product category</li>
<li>Click on a product image</li>
<li>Add the product to the cart</li>
<li>Check out and finalize purchase</li>
</ul>
<p>One property to note about user funnels is that typically there will be some<br />
dropoff in the users that move from step to step. This is much like how an<br />
actual funnel narrows from a large opening to a small exit. Outside of an<br />
experiment, funnels can be used to analyze user flows. Observations from these<br />
flows can then be used to motivate experiments to try and improve the dropoff<br />
rates.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that the flow through a funnel might be idealized<br />
compared to actual user practice. In the above example, users might perform<br />
multiple searches in a single session, or want to purchase multiple things. A<br />
user might access the site through a specific link, subverting the top part of<br />
the funnel. Refining the funnel and being specific about the kinds of events<br />
that are expected can help you create a consistent, reliable design and<br />
analysis.</p>
<h3 id="unit-of-diversion">Unit of Diversion</h3>
<p>Once you have a funnel, think about how you can implement your experimental<br />
manipulation in the funnel. If the goal of the above experiment was to change<br />
the way the site looks after a user clicks on a product image, we need to<br />
figure out a way to assign users to either a control group or experimental<br />
group. The place in which you make this assignment is known as the <strong>unit of
diversion</strong>. Depending on the type of experiment you have, you might have<br />
different options for diversion, each with its own pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event-based diversion (e.g. pageview): Each time a user loads up the page of<br />
interest, the experimental condition is randomly rolled. Since this ignores<br />
previous visits, this can create an inconsistent experience, if the condition<br />
causes a user-visible change.</li>
<li>Cookie-based diversion: A cookie is stored on the user's device, which<br />
determines their experimental condition as long as the cookie remains on the<br />
device. Cookies don't require a user to have an account or be logged in, but<br />
can be subverted through anonymous browsing or a user just clearing out cookies.</li>
<li>Account-based diversion (e.g. User ID): User IDs are randomly divided into<br />
conditions. Account-based diversions are reliable, but requires users to <em>have</em><br />
accounts and be logged in. This means that our pool of data might be limited in<br />
scope, and you'll need to consider the risks of using personally-identifiable<br />
information.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to selecting a unit of diversion, the consistency of the<br />
experience required can be a major factor to consider. For the example provided,<br />
we need something more consistent than pageview events. So we then consider the<br />
cookie-based diversion. If the differences in interface between control and<br />
experiment are fairly minor, then we're probably okay with cookie-based<br />
diversion. But if we think that users will notice the change and we believe<br />
that it will have a major effect on experience, then we might be inclined to<br />
choose an account-based diversion.</p>
<h3 id="invariant-and-evaluation-metrics">Invariant and Evaluation Metrics</h3>
<p>A funnel will also be of benefit when it comes to deciding on metrics to track<br />
and analyze as part of the experiment. The immediate features that come out of<br />
a funnel come in the form of counts and ratios. For example, we could count the<br />
number of times a search results in a product being selected (a count), or the<br />
ratio of selections to searches as adjacent slices in the funnel (a ratio).</p>
<p>There are two major categories that we can consider features: as <em>evaluation
metrics</em> or as <em>invariant metrics</em>. <strong>Evaluation metrics</strong> were mentioned in <br />
the previous page as the metrics by which we compare groups. Ideally, we hope <br />
to see a difference between groups that will tell us if our manipulation was <br />
a success. We might want to see an increased click-through-rate from search <br />
results to products, or an increase in overall revenue. On the flip side, <br />
<strong>invariant metrics</strong> are metrics that we hope will <em>not</em> be different between <br />
groups. Metrics in this category serve to check that the experiment is running <br />
as expected. For example, in an experiment with cookie-based diversion, the <br />
number of cookies generated for each condition would be a good invariant metric. <br />
Another metric could compare the distribution of times in which cookies were <br />
generated, to check the bias in the randomization procedure.</p>
<p>We're not limited to tracking just one metric of each type. It's not unusual <br />
to track multiple invariant metrics as checks on the system's integrity, or <br />
multiple evaluation metrics to check different potential facets of a <br />
manipulation's effects. Don't think that you need to track every possible <br />
metric, however. It's better to focus on a few key metrics, ignoring features <br />
that might be less reliable or highly correlated to other, more informative <br />
features. We'll discuss statistical considerations surrounding metrics in the <br />
next lesson.</p>
