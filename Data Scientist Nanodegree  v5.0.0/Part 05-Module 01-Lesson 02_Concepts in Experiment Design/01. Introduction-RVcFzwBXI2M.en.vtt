00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.315
What if I told you that lawyers in New York were driving up the price of apples.

00:00:10.314 --> 00:00:12.189
Take a look at this chart,

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:16.524
tracking both of these values from 1992 to 2006.

00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:20.195
Since they increase and decrease in a similar pattern,

00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:24.039
maybe lawyers like to eat apples so much that apples are forced

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.064
to cost more or maybe it's the other way around.

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:30.375
The more expensive apples are,

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:33.734
more people welcome lawyers to pay for them.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:36.500
This seems kind of silly, doesn't it?

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.840
It's a big leap of logic to say that the number of lawyers is directly

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.920
connected to the price of apples simply because they have a mathematical relationship.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.640
After all, there might be other variables that we haven't considered.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.390
The population of New York has steadily increased over the same time frame,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.060
and inflation will naturally increase the price of goods as time goes on.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.025
So, the relationship that we see in the original plot might simply be a coincidence.

00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:09.680
The number of lawyers and the price of apples might

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.785
both be going up based on other factors across time.

00:01:13.784 --> 00:01:17.000
It's relationships like this that give meaning to

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.079
the phrase that correlation does not imply causation.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.039
Just because you see that two variables are related to one another

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.405
doesn't mean that when one changes the other one is cost to change as well.

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:32.540
However, there will be cases where you do want to

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.665
say that one variable causes another to change.

00:01:35.665 --> 00:01:41.660
You might want to say that changes to your website cause visitors to make more purchases

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.479
or maybe you want to show that changes to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.145
your recommendation engine provide better search results to your users.

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:51.429
To test your hypotheses,

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.340
you should run an experiment.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.930
This is why experiment design is so important for data scientists to know about

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.960
to understand the scope of conclusions that they can make from their data.

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.745
In this lesson, you'll learn what it takes to build an experiment.

00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:12.444
You will learn about the types of experiments,

00:02:12.444 --> 00:02:14.280
ways of measuring outcomes,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.879
and pitfalls to check for when designing an experiment.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.794
By the end of this lesson,

00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:21.709
you will know what is required to create

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.700
experiments that effectively addressed your goals.
