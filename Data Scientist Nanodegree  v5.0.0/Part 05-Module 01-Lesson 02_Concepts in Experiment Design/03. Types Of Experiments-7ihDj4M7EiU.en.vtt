00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:07.439
Within the experiment type of study,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.960
there are different types of experiments.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.300
In this video, we will study some of them.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.269
Let's take another look at the earlier example regarding the online store.

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.000
There, we wanted to test the effects of adding

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.559
a summary overlay when a user clicks on a product image following a search.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:32.314
The experimental setup that we had there was an example of an A/B test.

00:00:32.314 --> 00:00:35.094
For each customer, we roll a die.

00:00:35.094 --> 00:00:39.030
If it's even, the customer gets put into group a.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.140
These participants won't see any changes.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.789
They'll still see the old product results without any Quick View overlay.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.570
Participants in group A are part of the control group.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.640
On the other hand, if the roll is odd,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.429
the customer will go into group B.

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.890
This group will see the website changes and be able to see

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.375
the Quick View for any product returned from a search.

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:09.454
Participants in group B will be part of the experimental group.

00:01:09.454 --> 00:01:12.230
Once we've collected all of our data,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.740
we can make an inference on the overlay by comparing the purchases on

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:21.140
the new website in group B to the purchases on the old website in group A.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.010
The A/B test I just described is also an example of a between-subjects design.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.460
In an experiment of this type,

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:32.614
each person only participates in one condition.

00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:34.390
For the website example,

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.510
customers only see site A or site B, but never both.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.800
In contrast, we can use an experiment type where

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.905
participants go through all of the experiment conditions.

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:49.500
This is called a within-subjects design.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.454
For example, let's say we wanted to conduct a taste test between two soft drink formulas.

00:01:55.454 --> 00:01:57.885
As a between-subjects experiment,

00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:04.060
each participant would simply be randomized to rate either formula A or formula B alone.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.359
If we make this A within-subjects design instead,

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.150
each participant would then rate both formulas,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.760
either A then B or B then A.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.689
The benefit of this kind of design is that we can

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.740
account for each individual's overall taste.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.300
If a person only tasted formula A and gave it a rating of eight,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.980
we wouldn't necessarily know what part of that was due to

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:32.379
the person's general inclinations toward soda and what part was due to the soda formula.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.335
Having that person make an additional rating on

00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:39.135
B allows us to account for that person's full preferences,

00:02:39.134 --> 00:02:42.454
reducing the variance in the data to be analyzed.

00:02:42.455 --> 00:02:47.295
However, it's not always possible to run a within-subjects design.

00:02:47.294 --> 00:02:51.349
If you consider the earlier example for the shopping website,

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.034
there's no good way of requiring a shopper to see both versions of the site.

00:02:56.034 --> 00:02:58.484
Once the shopper has made a purchase,

00:02:58.485 --> 00:03:01.280
there is no way to turn back time and have them make

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.590
the same purchase again in the version that they didn't see.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.849
There's also no guarantee that they'll come back

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.144
soon enough to give them the other version of the site.

00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:16.075
Of course, it doesn't make sense to randomly have both versions in the same session.

00:03:16.074 --> 00:03:17.824
In both of the examples,

00:03:17.824 --> 00:03:20.909
we split people up among two conditions: the two

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.405
different website flows or the two different soda formulas.

00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:28.865
But it's also possible to create designs where you might have more conditions.

00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:33.540
For example, one control group and two experimental groups.

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:37.870
There are also designs where you collect data in different ways.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.759
You can see more about these other experimental designs below.
