  <h2 id="ethics-in-experimentation">Ethics in Experimentation</h2>
<p>Before you run an experiment, it's important to consider the ethical treatments<br />
to which you subject your participants. Through the mid-20th century, exposure<br />
of questionable and clearly unethical research in the social and medical<br />
sciences spurred the creation of guidelines for ethical treatment of human<br />
subjects in studies and experiments. While different fields have developed<br />
different standards, they still have a number of major points in common:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Minimize participant risk</strong>: Experimenters are obligated to construct<br />
experiments that minimize the risks to participants in the study. Risk of harm<br />
isn't just in the physical sense, but also the mental sense. If an experimental <br />
condition has potential to negatively affect a participant's emotions or <br />
mentality, then it's worth thinking about if the risks are really necessary to <br />
perform the desired investigation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have clear benefits for risks taken</strong>: In some cases, risks may be <br />
unavoidable, and so they must be weighed against the benefits that may come <br />
from performing the study. When expectations for the study are not clearly <br />
defined, this throws into question the purpose of exposing subjects to risk. <br />
However, if the benefits are shown to be worth the risks, then it is still <br />
possible for the study to be run. This often comes up in medicine, where test <br />
treatments should show worthy potential against alternative approaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide informed consent</strong>: Building up somewhat from the previous two <br />
points, subjects should be informed of and agree to the risks and benefits of <br />
participation before they join the study or experiment. This is also an <br />
opportunity for a participant to opt out of participation. However, there are <br />
some cases where deception is necessary. This might be to avoid biasing the <br />
participant's behavior by seeding their expectations, or if there is a dummy <br />
task surrounding the actual test to be performed. In cases like this, it's <br />
important to include a debriefing after the subject's participation so that <br />
they don't come away from the task feeling mislead.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Handle sensitive data appropriately</strong>: If you're dealing with identifiable <br />
information in your study, make sure that you take appropriate steps to protect <br />
their anonymity from others. Sensitive information includes things like names, <br />
addresses, pictures, timestamps, and other links from personal identifiers to <br />
account information and history. Collected data should be anonymized as much as <br />
possible; surveys and census results are often also aggregated to avoid tracing <br />
outcomes back to any one person.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the formal sciences, an experiment proposal must go through a review board <br />
before it can be run, to ensure that ethical principles have been followed. <br />
It's likely that you won't have a review board to submit your designs to prior <br />
to running an experiment. You'll need to evaluate these principles for yourself <br />
or with your colleagues to check for potential ethical issues before going <br />
forward with a study design.</p>
<p>One particular point worth further discussion is that of informed consent for<br />
web-based experiments. It's often the case that when an experiment is run,<br />
users who are included in an experiment often don't know that they're<br />
participating in an experiment. If a manipulation carries no risk and is so<br />
minor as to be hidden away from the user (e.g. a change in recommendation<br />
engine), perhaps there is no need for informed consent. And when it comes to<br />
bias, it's known that peoples' behaviors can change when they know they are <br />
under observation. In practice, informed consent is often not considered when <br />
performing a web experiment.</p>
<p>However, informed consent is still an important ethical principle, so there is <br />
continuing debate on how to best obtain consent for users of a website. One <br />
option could be to allow users to opt out of experiment participation, with the <br />
default user agreement implying consent to participation in unobtrusive <br />
experiments. An opposing option would only run experiments on users who opt-<em>in</em><br />
to participation, asking the user to set their preference on their initial <br />
visit or registration. The opt-in approach is more in line with the core idea <br />
of informed consent, but also risks fewer users available for testing changes.</p>

  <h3 id="examples-in-experimental-ethics">Examples in Experimental Ethics</h3>
<p>Here are three studies in the social and medical sciences that are often <br />
brought up as examples of violations of experimental ethics and progenitors of <br />
the movement to establish ethics guidelines and boards:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tuskegee Syphilis Study</a>: <br />
This study was started in 1932, where hundreds of African-American men were <br />
tracked over the course of up to forty years to study the natural progression <br />
of syphilis. The subjects were denied treatment, even after the development of <br />
effective syphilis treatments like penicillin, and there were active steps taken <br />
to hide the truth of their conditions and treatments to the subjects.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Milgram obedience study</a>:<br />
During the mid 1960s, psychologist Stanley Milgram tested to what degree people <br />
follow authority figures. Participants were asked to administer gradually <br />
increasing shocks to an acting confederate participant at the behest of a lead <br />
experimenter based on mistakes made on a dummy memory test used as a cover <br />
story. While no shocks were <em>actually</em> administered, the study did bing forth <br />
questions on what constitutes adequate debriefing and what level of information <br />
and informed consent needs to be provided to a participant in a study that <br />
includes necessary deceptive elements.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stanford Prison Experiment</a>:<br />
This 1971 study conducted by psychologist Philip Zimbardo was built to test the <br />
dynamics and effects of power differences, using a prison scenario. Study <br />
volunteers were divided into prisoner and guard groups and their dynamics <br />
observed; the study had to be ended after less than a week due to the <br />
increasingly harsh conditions the 'guards' had settled into treating the <br />
'prisoners'. It has since served as a major ground for ethical criticisms, <br />
violating now-established guidelines around risks to participants and clarity <br />
of purpose. There are also methodological criticisms, as experimenter biases <br />
may have shaped the behavior of the 'guards' group in their interactions with <br />
'prisoners'.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here's a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/29/ethics-in-a-data-driven-world/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Techcrunch article</a> <br />
discussing the ethics of the 2014-published Facebook study on the impact of <br />
changing the affect of posts seen on users' feeds to their own posting habits.</p>
