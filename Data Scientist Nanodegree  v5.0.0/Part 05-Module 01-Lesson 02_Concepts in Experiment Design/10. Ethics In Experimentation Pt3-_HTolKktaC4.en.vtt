00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.970
The final principle is to maintain good data sensitivity and privacy.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.269
If you're collecting information about individuals that could identify them,

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.179
then you need to be careful that the data you collect is kept

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.379
secure and only made available to those who need to see it.

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:25.884
Sensitive information includes fields like name,

00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:30.790
account number, street address, pictures, and timestamps.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.359
If you need to publish findings that make use of sensitive information,

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:38.565
make sure that it has been anonymized and perhaps

00:00:38.564 --> 00:00:42.864
aggregated so that individuals can't be backtraced from the data.

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:47.505
Sometimes, just basic anonymization isn't always enough.

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:50.855
An America Online data leak from 2006,

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:56.544
accidentally released information about search terms by users over a three month period.

00:00:56.545 --> 00:00:58.910
Although there weren't names specifically

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.969
attached to the searches made by each account ID,

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.314
the searches were enough information for the New York Times

00:01:05.314 --> 00:01:09.549
to identify specific people from the released dataset.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.790
Handling ethical issues isn't always cut and dry.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.325
Sometimes, the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable is hard to decide.

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:22.100
In the medical and social science fields,

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:26.390
Institutional Review Boards or IRBs have been set up to

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.980
review experiment proposals to make sure that the risks have been properly considered,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.025
and the benefits line up appropriately.

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:38.130
But unless you're conducting research through one of those institutions,

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:43.364
it's likely that you will not have IRB oversight on your own experiments.

00:01:43.364 --> 00:01:46.939
So, it's very important to be aware of these issues,

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.859
so that you do not put undue risk on

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.329
your users when you make potentially impactful changes.
