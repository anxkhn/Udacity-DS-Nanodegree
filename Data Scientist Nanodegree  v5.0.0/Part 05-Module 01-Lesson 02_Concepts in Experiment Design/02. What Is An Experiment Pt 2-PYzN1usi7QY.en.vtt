00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.349
Sometimes, you might not be able to

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:10.890
run a true experiment to test your hypotheses due to not having

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.280
multiple groups or not being able to control random assignment to groups.

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.794
This will require you to consider alternative study designs.

00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:23.425
We can think of the types of study as lying on a spectrum

00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:27.664
based on the amount of control we have over the variables in play.

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:30.094
On the end with a high level of control,

00:00:30.094 --> 00:00:32.195
we have an experiment.

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:34.429
On the complete opposite side,

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:38.634
where we have no control is the observational study.

00:00:38.634 --> 00:00:43.509
A classic example of this is on the risks posed by smoking.

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:46.625
The hypothesis is that smoking tobacco

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:50.869
increases the likelihood of developing diseases like lung cancer.

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:54.799
Due to the risks of subjects actually developing a disease,

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:58.729
it would be unreasonable not to mention unethical for us to

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.509
make people smoke in order to run an experiment for testing our hypothesis.

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:08.750
Instead, we need to rely on collecting data passively making connections

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.840
between smoking rates and disease incidences based on groups or matched individuals.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.125
Establishing causality is very difficult

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:21.700
or perhaps even impossible with an observational study,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.260
but if the feature of interest is something that

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.375
the researcher cannot or should not manipulate,

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:31.780
then an observational design might be the only path to take.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.000
You can also have studies that fall in the middle

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.194
of observational studies and experiments.

00:01:38.194 --> 00:01:40.159
If your study applies some,

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.625
but not all of the controls required of a true experiment,

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:46.915
then you have a quasi-experiment instead.

00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:50.570
One example of this is when a video game company rolls out

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.414
a patch to modify character and item attributes.

00:01:54.415 --> 00:01:59.035
This may then have an effect on character and item popularity.

00:01:59.034 --> 00:02:02.170
Since everyone is affected in the same way,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.445
this is a quasi-experiment.

00:02:04.444 --> 00:02:08.844
We only have one group to track and there's no control group.

00:02:08.844 --> 00:02:11.689
In our analysis, we can only compare

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:16.354
the games ecosystem from before the patch and from after the patch.

00:02:16.354 --> 00:02:20.239
If we do see changes then there is the possibility for

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.875
other factors to have caused these changes not just the patch itself.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:29.895
For this scenario, we wouldn't want to run the patch as a true experiment.

00:02:29.895 --> 00:02:34.500
If we randomly split users between pre-patch and post-patch groups,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.384
this fracturing could cause friction among the user base.

00:02:38.384 --> 00:02:43.094
Friends could end up in different versions and unable to play with one another.

00:02:43.094 --> 00:02:47.625
Even if we made a beta patch available for players to test out changes,

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:50.120
this still wouldn't be a true experiment since

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.585
the players would be self-selecting themselves into the test.

00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:56.450
It's quite possible that the players that will want to

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.909
try out a new patch are different from the players in

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.245
the general population limiting

00:03:01.245 --> 00:03:05.390
our ability to make conclusions about the effect of the patch.
