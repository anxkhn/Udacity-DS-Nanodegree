00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.514
In addition to checking validity,

00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:11.205
you'll want to check for sources of bias in your experimental designs.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:14.759
For humans, biases are often seen as bad but

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.984
adaptively can sometimes help you make quick efficient decisions.

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:22.679
For an experiment, biases is always bad.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.109
Bias in an experiment refers to

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.394
systematic errors that affect the interpretability of your results.

00:00:29.394 --> 00:00:35.109
Here, we'll cover a few of the major biases that can be present in an experiment.

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.710
One type of bias is a sampling bias,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.935
where your sample is not representative of the population as a whole.

00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:46.460
This pops up a lot in non-experiments.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.174
People working in survey research often have to contend with biases in self-selection,

00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:57.004
where respondents very frequently fail to respond to survey requests.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:59.810
It's possible that those people who responded are

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.705
qualitatively different from those who didn't.

00:01:02.704 --> 00:01:05.239
Maybe they have more time to take surveys

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.030
or maybe it's because they're more invested in the survey topic.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.468
Careful matching of the collected data to the population

00:01:12.468 --> 00:01:16.339
is needed to overcome this kind of bias effect.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.550
But sampling bias isn't limited to non-experiments.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.439
We can also have this in an experiment if we're not careful.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.325
Let's say that we're running the experiment on the quick view overlay,

00:01:28.325 --> 00:01:31.045
but we have a problem with the random assignment.

00:01:31.045 --> 00:01:33.650
What if customers are systematically assigned

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.790
the control group between midnight and noon,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.910
and the experiment group between noon and midnight.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.789
The kinds of people who access the site during

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.940
these time frames might not be equivalent to one another,

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.939
introducing a bias into the analysis of the results.

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.159
Another type of bias is a novelty bias.

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.670
As you might guess, this is a bias that comes

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.560
from the introduction of something new to customers.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.025
For the quick view overlay example,

00:02:03.025 --> 00:02:05.620
you might see an initial up or down tick in

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.509
usage due to the sheer fact that the overlay is something new.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.474
Maybe users aren't used to the overlay at the start

00:02:12.474 --> 00:02:16.465
causing them to temporarily hold off on making purchases.

00:02:16.465 --> 00:02:18.640
After some time however,

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:22.794
the novelty will wear off and users will get used to the changes.

00:02:22.794 --> 00:02:27.539
This will let you see the true effect of the experimental manipulation.

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.264
For within subjects experiments,

00:02:30.264 --> 00:02:34.209
there are a few related biases based on the order of conditions.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.760
Primacy bias is somewhat related to novelty and

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:41.689
refers to changes due to a condition being first in the order.

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.530
On the opposite side,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.205
recency bias refers to changes due to conditions being last in the order.

00:02:48.205 --> 00:02:50.960
For example, if you present a number of

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.010
product samples to testers and asked them to rate each of them,

00:02:55.009 --> 00:03:00.069
testers might anchor their ratings around the value of the first one, a primacy bias.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.439
Alternatively, testers might favor the last sample due

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.094
to it being fresh in their minds, a recency bias.

00:03:07.094 --> 00:03:11.060
The presence of these primacy and recency effects is why it is

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.120
so important to make sure that the order of conditions is balanced.
