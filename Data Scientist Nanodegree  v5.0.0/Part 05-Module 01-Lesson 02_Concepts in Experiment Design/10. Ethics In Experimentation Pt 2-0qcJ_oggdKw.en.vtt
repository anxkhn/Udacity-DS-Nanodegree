00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.205
A third ethical principle is based on informed consent.

00:00:09.205 --> 00:00:12.359
In traditional research, researchers are required to

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.739
inform participants of risks and benefits of a study.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.690
Participants then have to explicitly agree to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.145
participating in a study before they can proceed.

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:25.228
If there's any deception required to run the task,

00:00:25.228 --> 00:00:30.324
then researchers will also need to perform a debriefing at the experiment's conclusion.

00:00:30.324 --> 00:00:34.075
This line is blurred when it comes to experiments on the Web.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:37.230
When study subjects know that they're under observation,

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:41.219
they change their behaviors to the possible detriment of the research.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.969
So, how can users be brought into a study

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.780
smoothly without unnaturally affecting their behaviors?

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.960
In many cases, experiments are argued to be

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.285
covered under user agreements or terms of services.

00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:56.404
But perhaps, we can do better.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:59.899
There's an argument to allow users to opt out of being a part of

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.144
experiments through a setting on their profile, perhaps a checkbox.

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:10.119
But the debate on how to best handle consent for online testing is still ongoing.
