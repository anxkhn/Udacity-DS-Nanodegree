00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.240
When it comes to setting up an experimental design,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.945
one mnemonic that can be used to guide its creation is smart.

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:15.570
This mnemonic was originally created in

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.780
the context of project planning for companies and teams,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.900
but it also applies pretty well two experiments.

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.539
Each letter in smart stands for

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.695
a different criteria that the experiment specifications should achieve.

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:33.750
The goals of your experiment must be specific.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.945
There must be a way to measure outcomes objectively.

00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:41.250
Your goal and the steps that you take towards that goal,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.715
both must be achievable.

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:48.725
Your experiment should be relevant to the larger goals of the organization,

00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:53.984
and finally the experiment should be completable in a timely fashion.

00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:58.215
The points and the mnemonic won't cover every part of experiment design.

00:00:58.215 --> 00:01:00.800
So, don't rely on it too much.

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:03.769
For example, it doesn't tell you if you've got sources of

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.605
bias or if the experiment conforms to ethical guidelines.

00:01:07.605 --> 00:01:10.640
Instead, it's best as a sanity check.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.799
A top-level guide to make sure major design concepts are covered.
