00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.910
For the first two questions regarding studying techniques and coding boot camps,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.030
we need to wrangle our data and then we were mostly able to use

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:16.119
descriptive statistics to find our solutions to our questions of interest.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.810
But we did also use a little inference to look at significant salary differences.

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:26.304
We don't really need to use modeling to answer either of these two questions though,

00:00:26.304 --> 00:00:28.265
so we can skip this part.

00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:33.030
However, to make predictions of an individual's job satisfaction or salary,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.070
we're going to need to wrangle our data,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.795
and then introduce the next step of the process: building a predictive model.

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:43.524
Predictive models are one type of machine learning algorithm,

00:00:43.524 --> 00:00:45.679
known as supervised machine learning.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.534
Modeling as a data scientist is often considered the fun part

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:53.509
of the data science job because of libraries like scikit-learn and Python.

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:56.879
Let's see how we can use that in this situation.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.080
A simplified four-step process for modeling using

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.369
scikit-learn is to first instantiate our model.

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:06.519
Second, to fit our model to the training data.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:12.349
Third, predict using your fitted model on some test data and then finally,

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:16.655
score your model using a metric to evaluate how well it performs.

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:19.099
Let's see how we might use modelling in

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:22.409
this process to predict salary for an individual in this data set.
