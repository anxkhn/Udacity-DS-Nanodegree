00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.429
A quick look through

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:08.369
the data set shows a number of factors that should be able to

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.820
help us better understand more about an individual salary.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.230
They're quantitative factors like the number of hours a week and individual works,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.365
or how satisfied they are with their job or their career.

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:23.309
They're also categorical variables like the country they live in,

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:26.539
their company size, or formal education.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.449
When building supervised machine learning models,

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.314
we're looking for a way to take all of these inputs and predict an individual value.

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:38.000
In this case, the individual salary.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.130
We would like our model to find structure and how these inputs relate to some response

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.679
variable so that we end up with predictions that

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.575
are as close to the actual values as possible.

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:53.080
Let's see how well different algorithms perform on this data set.
