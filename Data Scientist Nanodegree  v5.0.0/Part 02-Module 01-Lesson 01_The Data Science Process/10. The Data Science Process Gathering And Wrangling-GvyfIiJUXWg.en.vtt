00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:05.310
In the previous video,

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:08.459
you were introduced to the four questions that we'll focus on

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.050
while working on the remaining steps in the CRISP-DM process.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.615
The next step in the process is about gathering the data

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:19.769
and organizing it in a way that will allow us to answer our questions of interests.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.704
Fortunately for us, Stack Overflow already gathered the data.

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:26.224
However, to answer our questions of interests,

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:29.260
there are still some steps we'll need to perform.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.105
The wrangling process is said to be the most time-consuming,

00:00:33.104 --> 00:00:36.979
often taking 80 percent of the data analysis process.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.569
Let's dive in and take a look at what we'll need to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.560
do with some of the data to find the insights.
