00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.540
When considering dropping columns,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.830
it's useful to consider what proportion of the column is missing.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.699
If only 5 percent of a column is missing,

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.375
then it probably isn't one that you want to drop.

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:21.600
Especially, if it's a particularly interesting column for the questions that you have.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.890
It would be a shame to drop it.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.399
However, if say, 90 percent of the column is missing,

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.695
well, now we have a reason to consider dropping that column.

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:34.079
What if there's 50 percent of the values missing?

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.674
Should we remove this column?

00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:38.239
Will we lose a bunch of information by removing it?

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.579
No matter how much data is missing,

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.339
attempting to create an informative feature of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.420
the missing information is a useful strategy.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.800
You may want to create a dummy variable,

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:52.234
that indicates which rows have missing values.

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:57.015
Here, this new column is a one if the original had a missing value,

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:58.829
and a zero otherwise.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.155
This may very well improve your predictions over a model that simply remove this column.

00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:06.859
If it doesn't, then at least you tried,

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:08.269
and we can feel confident that

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:12.159
the missing information wasn't a useful indicator for prediction.
