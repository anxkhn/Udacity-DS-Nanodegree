00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.384
Now, let's look at the second question of interest.

00:00:02.384 --> 00:00:04.500
That is, what does the data suggest about

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.919
boot camp grads in terms of job placement and salary?

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.234
Again, let's read in the data and the necessary libraries.

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:13.289
In the case of our second question,

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.504
we were only interested in boot camp grads.

00:00:15.505 --> 00:00:19.380
Let's narrow our dataset down to just those individuals.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:22.855
Looks like there's about 2,600 of them in this dataset.

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:25.560
Many boot camps suggest that they're aimed at helping

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.949
people who are underrepresented in the technical community.

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.464
Let's take a look at some of those characteristics and see what shows up in our dataset.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:37.110
Looking at gender, here's the breakdown of those different areas,

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:40.365
86 percent male, 11 percent female,

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:44.265
and the remaining three percent or so,

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:46.679
a little less than three percent are in some,

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.409
one of these other groups.

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.354
If we compare this to the gender breakdown of the non-boot camp grads,

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:57.289
we can see if they're really helping the underrepresented groups.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.144
As you can see, there is about a four percent larger group in the males,

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:06.795
and that basically directly comes from the female portion.

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:14.290
So, there is a slight increase of females in boot camps than in the current industry.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.670
However, as far as the rest of the groups are concerned, it's about the same.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.475
Additionally, we could look at a breakdown by formal education.

00:01:21.474 --> 00:01:23.354
So, of those who were in the boot camp,

00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:29.760
about 48 percent had a bachelor's degree before going in,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.255
and 23 percent have a master's degree.

00:01:33.254 --> 00:01:35.894
And you can see the breakdown of some of these other things,

00:01:35.894 --> 00:01:40.155
even two percent have a doctoral degree,

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:42.945
and 1.6 percent have a professional degree.

00:01:42.944 --> 00:01:47.189
Pretty high in like a pretty large number of years and

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.724
the traditional education world before moving over to a boot camp.

00:01:52.724 --> 00:01:55.149
And then, if we look at,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.960
this is the people who are not in a boot camp,

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.894
and we see the breakdown of them.

00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:03.033
You can see that fewer of them have a bachelor's degree,

00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:05.534
about the same have a master's degree,

00:02:05.534 --> 00:02:08.805
about the same have some college,

00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:11.115
about the same for a PhD,

00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:13.469
and for a professional degree.

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:18.879
So, it looks like they're polling more people with bachelor's degrees.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.769
So, that's kind of interesting.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.585
There's like six percent increase of those individuals going into here.

00:02:25.585 --> 00:02:30.615
But it doesn't look like it's really changing the professional,

00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:34.500
doctoral, or masters degrees that much.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.425
People are just choosing another form of education that isn't a master's or

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:42.588
PhD after getting a bachelor's according to this.

00:02:42.588 --> 00:02:46.919
More of them are getting a bachelor's and they're choosing one of those two routes.

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.099
Another interesting column that we could look at is basically how much time after

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.759
the boot camp it takes for an individual to find a job.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:56.609
So, here's an interesting part about the boot camp.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.945
Persona is that 46 percent of those individuals already had jobs,

00:03:01.944 --> 00:03:04.884
11 percent got them immediately after graduating,

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:09.375
and then about 10 percent got jobs as developers before completing the program.

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:11.120
So, that's, what is that?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:20.530
56, 64 percent have jobs before completing the program or right at graduation,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.750
or they already had them.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.330
And then 1-3 months afterwards,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.640
takes about nine percent of people to find a job in that spectrum,

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:36.569
and just under 10 percent still haven't had a job since completing the survey

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.180
which is kind of tough because you don't know if they just

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.545
graduated or maybe they graduated six months later,

00:03:43.544 --> 00:03:45.579
or maybe it's been nine months or a year,

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.743
or something like that.

00:03:46.743 --> 00:03:50.039
This status is kind of hard to read because you don't

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:54.060
know the time frame that those individuals are falling into.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.504
So, another interesting thing we could look at,

00:03:56.504 --> 00:04:00.900
is the salary breakdown of these individuals who came from boot camps.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.425
So here, I'll just build a histogram of the salary with 20 bins.

00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:06.930
And if we take a look at this,

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.840
you can see that it's kind of all over the place.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.069
So, there's somebody up here makes $200,000 a year, and then,

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.129
it looks like there's a huge spike right here at the beginning

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:21.629
which might be those individuals who are still searching for work,

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:24.855
and then there's still just a huge spectrum.

00:04:24.855 --> 00:04:28.110
So, boot camps don't seem to be very consistent in

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.290
terms of where people's salaries are likely to fall.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.615
There are clearly other factors that are involved

00:04:33.615 --> 00:04:37.215
besides just whether or not someone went to a boot camp or not.

00:04:37.214 --> 00:04:40.274
So, my biggest question is coming into this were,

00:04:40.274 --> 00:04:44.099
how were the placement rates and what kind of salaries can we expect?

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.600
And the truth is that,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.985
they're kind of widespread more than any other category.

00:04:48.985 --> 00:04:50.985
Most individuals had a job already

00:04:50.985 --> 00:04:53.949
before doing the boot camp or while doing the boot camp.

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.474
And so, it's hard to tell what influence that had on them.

00:04:58.475 --> 00:05:02.520
And then additionally, the salaries for those individuals are all over.
