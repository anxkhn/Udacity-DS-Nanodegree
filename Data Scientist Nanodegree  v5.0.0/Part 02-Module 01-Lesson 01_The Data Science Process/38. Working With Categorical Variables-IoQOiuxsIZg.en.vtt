00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.234
One of the most common methods

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:11.899
for encoding categorical variables is with ones and zeros.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.830
There are advantages to this method.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.289
With linear models, you have the ability to

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.724
easily interpret the weights on each of these values,

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:23.355
and it provides a lot of flexibility in determining

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:27.640
how each level of the categorical variable influences the response.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.835
On the downside, when a categorical variable has lots of levels,

00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:34.700
creating dummy variables encoded in this way,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.370
can add a lot of new columns into your dataset.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:42.784
In this dataset, we're working with 42,000 additional columns.

00:00:42.784 --> 00:00:46.559
If the number of columns were to exceed the number of rows,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.270
many machine learning algorithms will be unable to optimize for a solution at all.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.490
There are some additional techniques shown in the post and the links below.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.480
Let's try implementing this technique to see how it works out
