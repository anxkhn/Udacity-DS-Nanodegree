00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.209
So, in this video we're going to take a quick look at how to

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:06.830
use the workspaces in the classroom.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.310
And so, this is an example of one of

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.010
the Jupyter Notebooks that you might be working with.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.675
A couple of quick things about the workspace is that

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:21.179
I usually open up this tab so I can see exactly where I'm at in the classroom.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.879
If your workspace fails to load,

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:30.254
it might be useful to click around and then come back to it or just refresh the page.

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:35.189
And the other thing that you can do is reset or refresh the workspace itself,

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:37.233
using this menubar down here.

00:00:37.234 --> 00:00:42.609
So, these are most commonly used if your workspace fails to load.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.339
But once your workspace is loaded,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.394
you should be able to use it just as if it was a notebook on your local machine.

00:00:48.393 --> 00:00:51.914
You'll notice that you have all of the tabs of a regular Jupyter Notebook.

00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:54.229
And also if you hit this Jupyter icon,

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:55.529
up here in the top left,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.090
it'll take you behind the scenes of,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.145
like, everything that you have available.

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:01.140
And, the case of this workspace,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.094
you can see that there is a solution.

00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:05.480
And here is what looks like an empty notebook,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.045
and then another solution notebook,

00:01:07.045 --> 00:01:10.840
and it's empty notebook, that's what we had before.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.715
And then, some other files back here,

00:01:12.715 --> 00:01:15.799
like some data files and some testing files for the code

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.748
that you would write as a student.

00:01:19.748 --> 00:01:21.629
And, if we were to click through this,

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:24.314
so I'll just click through the, to the solution one.

00:01:24.314 --> 00:01:26.664
So, a lot of times in the workspace,

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:28.580
you'll see those in the back here,

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.515
so if you get stuck you can check out the solution,

00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:34.939
but also within the individual notebook.

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.284
So, if we run these, so here you can see we're just reading in some data.

00:01:39.284 --> 00:01:42.484
And, if we go to the first part it says,

00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:44.554
this should get the description.

00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:47.750
Here's the input, so it looks like we're creating this function.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.555
And there's like a way for you to test.

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:53.700
So, I'm just going to cheat.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.870
But if we wanted to,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.990
we could look at the solution here and by

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:04.584
running the first two cells you can see that basically it gives a description,

00:02:04.584 --> 00:02:06.849
so here's a way that you can test your code.

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:09.995
As you go through this particular program,

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:13.150
there are lots of tests that tell you, nice job,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.685
that you got it right or oftentimes like error.

00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:21.382
So, this first part is just to see if you're getting the thing that you expect.

00:02:21.382 --> 00:02:23.219
And then, we have a lot of.

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.435
So, if you'll notice up here,

00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:28.300
we read in test1 is t. So,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.500
there are a whole bunch of tests in that file that will check

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.104
your code against our solutions and make sure that they match up,

00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:40.179
and if they don't, we'll try to give you feedback as

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.814
to what we think you should do differently to get them to match.

00:02:43.814 --> 00:02:46.509
Yeah, so that's the main thing,

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:50.009
is that if you go back here,

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:51.829
there's a whole bunch of files.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.265
In general, we'll have it so it pops up to the file

00:02:54.264 --> 00:02:57.009
that we think you should be working on at that point in the class.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:01.719
But it's also the case that you can upload your own files so you'll

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.120
notice that there's an upload button here where you can

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.120
connect your own workbooks and bring them into the classroom.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.629
Or you can create new Python or text files within

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.414
here as well and save them into this particular workspace.

00:03:15.414 --> 00:03:20.304
Notice you can hit this Jupyter icon from your notebook,

00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:22.629
and select any of the files,

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.159
and then choose to download them.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.884
So, you can download individual files to your machine and then run them locally.

00:03:28.884 --> 00:03:32.139
If you would prefer to do that as opposed to working in the classroom.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.059
I've also provided a link down below

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.990
this video in case you don't want to download these one at a time.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.680
Again, just a quick recap,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.495
you can see that there's individual notebooks

00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:42.740
and solutions as well as the data back here.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.010
When you are in any individual notebook,

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:48.189
you should be able to run that just like you would from your local machine.

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.530
And so, with this particular example you should

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.020
be able to run the cells just like you would on

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.450
your own machine and we've built tests to

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.304
sort of make sure that you're on the right track with your notebook.

00:03:58.305 --> 00:03:59.599
If you do get stuck,

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.680
you'll notice that in the back you can take a look at

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.090
the solution files or even look at the solutions that you're running up against,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.330
to see why you might be missing something or

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.844
how we computed our solution in the background, great.

00:04:13.843 --> 00:04:20.769
Well, I hope this was useful as a way to see how to use the notebooks in the classroom.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.539
In general, if you're comfortable with

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.135
working with IPython notebooks on your local machine,

00:04:25.134 --> 00:04:28.904
this should feel very similar to that situation.

00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:31.019
And, yeah, thanks for joining me.
