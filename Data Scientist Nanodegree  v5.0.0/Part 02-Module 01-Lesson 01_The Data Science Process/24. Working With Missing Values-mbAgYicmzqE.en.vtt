00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.139
We just saw how missing values and working with

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:10.379
categorical variables introduced some complications

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.030
for fitting machine learning models with scikit-learn.

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.384
Let's see how we might find a solution.

00:00:15.384 --> 00:00:20.024
There isn't just one way to work with these missing values and categorical variables.

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:21.839
There are actually lots of ways.

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.480
So, scikit-learn doesn't want to just choose one way

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.875
for you because it might not be the best for the data that you're working with.

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:33.539
Here are three strategies for working with missing data.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.060
First, we could remove or drop the rows or columns.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.495
Second, we might choose to impute values.

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:44.359
Third, we can work around that.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.439
Let's take a closer look at the first of these three, removing data.
