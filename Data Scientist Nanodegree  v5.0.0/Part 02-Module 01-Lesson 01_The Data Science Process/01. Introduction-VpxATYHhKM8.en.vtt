In this lesson, you'll learn about the process used for many data science problems.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.850
This will serve you as a useful guide on how to

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.894
approach future data science problems as well as your first project.

00:00:15.894 --> 00:00:18.509
If some of this material feels like review,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.450
feel free to zip ahead to only the required parts.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.339
If you want a deeper understanding of any of the areas introduced in this lesson,

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.640
sit tight because we'll be doing just that later on in this program.
