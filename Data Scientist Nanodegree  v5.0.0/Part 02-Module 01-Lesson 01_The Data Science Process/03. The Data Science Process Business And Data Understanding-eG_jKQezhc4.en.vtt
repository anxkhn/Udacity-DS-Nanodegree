00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.759
In the previous video,

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.925
you received a quick look at the six steps of the CRISP-DM process.

00:00:09.925 --> 00:00:14.700
Let's take a look at the first two steps of this process in a bit more detail.

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.509
First, CRISP-DM says you need business understanding,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.660
but I think of data science as being more general than just business context,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.859
you need to understand the problem.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.359
Are you interested in acquiring new customers?

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.829
Are you interested in assessing of

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.189
a new cancer treatment outperforms existing treatments?

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.849
Are you interested in finding a better way to communicate,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.649
or travel, or retain information?

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.699
Each of these questions falls under business understanding.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.150
The second step of the CRISP-DM process is data understanding.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.710
This means you need to gain an understanding of

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.439
the data necessary to answer your question.

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:54.500
Sometimes you might have a mountain of data at

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.895
your disposal that you need to dig through to find insights.

00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:00.690
Other times you may need to collect data,

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:03.409
which means you will have to understand what kind of

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.179
data we'll be able to provide you with the insights you need.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.010
This is often difficult to know ahead of time,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.750
which is why businesses tend to collect all the data they can first,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.680
so they can later identify which data they need to use to find their insights.
