00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.700
In the last video,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.660
we saw three methods for working with missing data.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.675
The first of these methods was to remove rows or columns holding the missing values.

00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:19.109
First, it is useful to ask yourself why these values are missing.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.244
Often dropping data from your dataset can lead to bias models,

00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:26.214
this is also true for imputing data points.

00:00:26.214 --> 00:00:30.250
There isn't a universal best way for working with missing data,

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.174
so exploring different options can help you determine what's best for your situation.

00:00:35.174 --> 00:00:39.794
If missing data occurs from individuals who are not willing to share information,

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:43.245
and you build a model simply excluding those individuals,

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:45.489
you are likely to get poor results.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.530
Consider a survey that asks participants 150 questions about their personality type.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.890
I don't know about you,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.855
but I'm likely to give up after two or three questions.

00:00:55.854 --> 00:01:00.129
If you ask questions about relationships or financials in the survey,

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.615
a lack of response to these questions might indicate one personality type over another.

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:11.084
Dropping these missing values would remove information that we might be able to use.

00:01:11.084 --> 00:01:14.659
For example, we could create a column to keep track

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.109
of which questions each individual left blank,

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:23.090
or we can keep track of the number of missing values that occurred for each respondent.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.100
In these cases, we're actually using the missing data to improve predictions.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:31.399
However, removing individuals or columns with

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.280
missing data would likely hurt predictions due to the reduced information.
