00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.535
All right. So, here we'll go through the second video of how to break into the field.

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:08.220
So, essentially if this was our question of interest,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.835
what steps could we go through to analyze the data and try to answer it.

00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:14.430
So, the first question is,

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.774
in order to understand how to break into the field,

00:00:16.774 --> 00:00:19.000
we'll look at the CousinEducation field,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.929
use the schema data set to answer the question,

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.689
and write a function called get description that takes

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.075
the schema and the column as a string and returns the description for that column.

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:34.990
So, basically schema is the data set that we read in up here.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.460
So, and in this case we read into data sets.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.439
Again, a whole bunch of libraries and this test PI file that's going to run our code,

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:45.269
and make sure that it works the way it's supposed to.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.065
But we also have the schema data set that we're going to be working with.

00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:52.530
So, what might be useful to do is,

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.495
again if we create,

00:00:54.494 --> 00:00:56.804
if we answer a cell above here,

00:00:56.804 --> 00:01:01.369
and we just take a quick look at what the schema data set looks like.

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:04.120
So, you'll see there's a column and a question,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.665
and basically what we want to do is,

00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:11.063
we want to be able to take the column as a string,

00:01:11.063 --> 00:01:15.105
and then return the description.

00:01:15.105 --> 00:01:16.523
So, here's the description,

00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:18.269
over here in the question field,

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:20.174
and the column names over here.

00:01:20.174 --> 00:01:23.459
So, that means, we're going to

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.242
take schema which is getting passed in as an argument here.

00:01:27.242 --> 00:01:28.991
It's one of the inputs.

00:01:28.992 --> 00:01:37.030
And we want the column to be equal to the column name.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.750
And when that's true,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.915
we basically want to grab

00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:50.205
the schema portion where that's true and yeah,

00:01:50.204 --> 00:01:54.215
and then just give back the question part.

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:58.155
So, if you imagine what this is doing and here is it saying,

00:01:58.155 --> 00:02:02.909
"I want you to go into the schema I want you to grab the column with

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.544
this column name that you pass me and then give me the description back out of that."

00:02:08.544 --> 00:02:10.419
So hopefully, this works.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.139
And if it does then we should,

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.004
oh, it didn't work.

00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:21.794
Shema, I have shema somewhere, schema, cool.

00:02:21.794 --> 00:02:23.519
So, it says that's

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.419
the respondent ID number and we can check it against the solution here.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.360
Oh no, it didn't work.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.560
So, series objects are mutable thus they cannot be hashed.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:47.045
So, we can go back here and if we look at how to break in the field and the solution,

00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:50.055
and we look at this.

00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:55.260
Oh, they turn them into a list and then pull it,

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.985
so back here. Try this again.

00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:06.120
So, they suggest doing this as a list and then pulling.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.685
So, then it's only that part.

00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:11.385
That's weird. Why?

00:03:11.385 --> 00:03:21.764
Schema, schema column

00:03:21.764 --> 00:03:27.066
equals equals country.

00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:29.804
It's now pulling that.

00:03:29.804 --> 00:03:34.270
I'm going to pull the question off of it.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.335
And it gives me that weird thing back.

00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:40.194
And if I ask for a list,

00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:42.524
then it only gives me the string back.

00:03:42.525 --> 00:03:45.300
Gives me like a Pandas Dataframe and if I pass it to a list,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.380
then it only gives me that.

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.990
And so then, the zero just pulls that string out of there.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.375
Tricky, that one was kind of tricky.

00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:59.680
So, then the question we've been focused on is,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.300
how to break into the field,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.490
which is this column here.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.015
And so, here's a description of that column.

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:11.259
So, we could read through this to understand better,

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:17.430
like why this is a useful thing to use to help us break into the field.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.060
This core set value says,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.024
"Provide a pandas series of accounts for each in the CousinEducation and then,

00:04:24.024 --> 00:04:25.462
make sure it looks right."

00:04:25.463 --> 00:04:34.700
So, this is just df (Cousin Education ) and then.value_counts.

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:40.834
It sure looks okay.

00:04:40.834 --> 00:04:43.685
So you'll notice, so this kind of looks bad.

00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:45.079
Like all of these things,

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:47.680
if somebody suggested more than one thing,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.723
it puts all of them together.

00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:51.980
So, this person suggested three different things,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.920
this person suggested four different things, and it lists them all.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.020
Well, and it's not just one person,s132 people suggested those and 140 suggested this.

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:07.043
And so, if we try to plot this as this shows down here.

00:05:07.043 --> 00:05:09.230
If we try to plot this,

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.230
it doesn't end up looking super good.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.275
It's probably going to take a long time because there's a lot of gross stuff in here.

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:18.354
And so instead of that,

00:05:18.355 --> 00:05:21.384
what we want to do is basically break this up so that there's

00:05:21.384 --> 00:05:26.514
a separate bar for each of the educational methods.

00:05:26.514 --> 00:05:29.394
Yeah, see this is worthless to us.

00:05:29.394 --> 00:05:30.877
We can't do anything with this.

00:05:30.877 --> 00:05:35.224
And so, what we'd like is these are all of the possible values.

00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:37.540
And so, we just want a single bar for each one and then,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.903
we want to know how often people suggest that.

00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:45.250
So, there was this method of basically cleaning,

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.290
which is taking each of these.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.600
And then, if we look at that,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.070
we're basically just taking each one and then,

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:56.944
plotting how often they show up.

00:05:56.944 --> 00:05:58.552
That looks a lot better,

00:05:58.552 --> 00:06:01.471
and this function is sort of a nice helper for that.

00:06:01.471 --> 00:06:05.740
So, I wonder if some of the individuals might have biased towards their own degrees,

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.150
complete the function below that will apply to

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:10.974
the elements of the formal education column in df.

00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:13.885
So, it says it wants the formal ed string

00:06:13.884 --> 00:06:17.589
which is a string of one of the values for the formal education,

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:23.507
and then it returns one if the string is in this and a zero otherwise.

00:06:23.507 --> 00:06:33.474
So, if formal_ed_str is in masters.

00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:36.189
Yeah, so basically in this,

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:38.439
so I'm just going to rip this part.

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:42.404
Put in here then return one,

00:06:42.404 --> 00:06:50.934
else return zero, return one, else return zero.

00:06:50.935 --> 00:06:55.720
And basically, it's going to apply that to the formal education.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.180
So, you can see one of them had one of these Professional,

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.115
Doctoral or, Masters degrees.

00:07:02.115 --> 00:07:06.715
And so, you can get an idea of what this is going to try to do but basically,

00:07:06.714 --> 00:07:09.269
we're looking at, did somebody have one of these higher degrees?

00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:12.714
And if they did, then we want to see if they might

00:07:12.714 --> 00:07:17.019
have a higher push for other people to get those types of degrees.

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:19.524
Whereas, if someone broke into the field

00:07:19.524 --> 00:07:22.377
and they didn't have one of those, do they feel differently?

00:07:22.377 --> 00:07:24.474
So, does your degree bias you

00:07:24.475 --> 00:07:28.305
towards pushing other people to take the same path that you did?

00:07:28.305 --> 00:07:31.360
Yeah, and then, basically this higher ed is the function.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.944
We're just using that and then we're going to take this in.

00:07:34.944 --> 00:07:36.730
And if you wrote the function correctly,

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.509
this is just checking it again using that test file.

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:46.173
Now it says, "Subset the data frame to only those with HigherEd equal to 1."

00:07:46.173 --> 00:07:56.241
So, df and I want to subset with df HigherEd is that what this is named?

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:58.045
Yeah. So, in this code,

00:07:58.045 --> 00:08:03.086
we created this new column called HigherEd and here they calculated the mean.

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:06.185
They didn't actually show it but they just showed that it matched.

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:12.214
And if we wanted to, we could also maybe just print that to make more sense out of this.

00:08:12.214 --> 00:08:16.269
Yeah, so it looks like about 23 percent of the individuals in

00:08:16.269 --> 00:08:20.952
this data set did earn one of those more advanced degrees.

00:08:20.952 --> 00:08:23.709
And here, we're going to subset the data set.

00:08:23.709 --> 00:08:28.719
So, to those that are one and

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:34.985
then ed zero is basically going to be those that were zero.

00:08:34.985 --> 00:08:41.465
And then here, we're going to just print these to make sure it looks like we expect.

00:08:41.465 --> 00:08:44.379
Yeah. So, the top one should be only those with

00:08:44.379 --> 00:08:47.799
one so we're basically just printing the ed one and if these are all ones,

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:51.794
then that's what we'd expect because we subseted it to be only the ones,

00:08:51.794 --> 00:08:53.439
and the second ones only zeros.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.880
If there were ones or zeros mixed into this,

00:08:55.879 --> 00:08:59.195
that would be different than what we might expect.

00:08:59.195 --> 00:09:01.399
And then, let's see,

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:04.169
this is a lot of code and it builds this cool plot.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.264
It says, "You can check out this link here."

00:09:06.264 --> 00:09:09.867
So, this was the link that was used to basically create this plot.

00:09:09.868 --> 00:09:11.480
But this is pretty cool here.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.690
So, this gives us some pretty useful insights and basically,

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.310
the red bars suggest that there are slight,

00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:23.132
so the size of the bar suggests how much it leans in one way versus the other,

00:09:23.133 --> 00:09:24.660
versus these two groups.

00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:28.894
So, basically the percentage of people who were in the one category,

00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:33.095
who suggested taking online courses is 20.5 percent.

00:09:33.095 --> 00:09:36.185
And the percentage of those who were,

00:09:36.184 --> 00:09:39.334
who did not earn one of those higher degrees,

00:09:39.335 --> 00:09:42.920
who suggested taking online courses was 21 percent which

00:09:42.919 --> 00:09:47.235
suggests that those who didn't earn one of the higher degrees were slightly larger.

00:09:47.235 --> 00:09:51.730
But you can see this green bar here is the largest of all of them.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:59.944
It's substantially larger than the rest of the bars which are 0.007 and says five zero,

00:09:59.943 --> 00:10:02.068
move the decimal place five places.

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:04.235
All of these are super small and then this one's

00:10:04.235 --> 00:10:07.544
a full two and a half percent in comparison.

00:10:07.544 --> 00:10:11.168
So, the rest of these don't even hit like one percent.

00:10:11.168 --> 00:10:14.600
But this one hits 2.5 percent.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.894
And you can see that it's associated with a Master's degree.

00:10:16.894 --> 00:10:22.039
So essentially, people who earned higher degrees suggest that the next step

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:27.307
for this person should be to go get a Master's degree where those who didn't do that,

00:10:27.307 --> 00:10:29.855
that's only three percent of them suggests that,

00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:32.090
a two and a half percent difference

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.450
which is the most substantial difference of anyone here.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.295
So, then it says "What can you conclude from the plot above?"

00:10:38.294 --> 00:10:41.424
And essentially here we should,

00:10:41.424 --> 00:10:43.109
if we run this.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.840
Let's see, so this says not quite right.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.301
So, there are some falses in here,

00:10:46.301 --> 00:10:48.200
and basically, we should change these to true or false.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.470
So, everyone should get a higher level of formal education.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.160
Well, I think that the results kind of argue that

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:59.089
you should choose the path that's best for yourself regardless of formal education.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:04.629
Online courses are the top suggested form of education and that's actually true as well.

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:08.794
I said something that suggested this was false and then change it to true.

00:11:08.794 --> 00:11:11.074
Regardless of formal education,

00:11:11.075 --> 00:11:13.015
online courses are the top suggested.

00:11:13.014 --> 00:11:16.220
So, yeah, taking online courses was the highest for either of

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.779
these substantially higher than any of the other ones.

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:22.579
There is less than a one percent difference between suggestions for

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.675
the top two groups for all forms of education.

00:11:25.674 --> 00:11:28.654
And that's not true because we saw this two and a half percent difference

00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:32.903
for those with higher formal education.

00:11:32.903 --> 00:11:34.769
And then, those with higher formal education

00:11:34.769 --> 00:11:37.490
