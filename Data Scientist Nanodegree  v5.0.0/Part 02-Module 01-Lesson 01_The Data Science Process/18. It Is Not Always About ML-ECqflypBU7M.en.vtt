00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.359
As you may have already noticed from answering the first two questions,

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.939
not every data science problem involves

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:14.955
the fanciest deep learning or machine learning algorithm.

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:19.469
Many data science problems and practice involve a question that needs answering,

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:21.739
the right amount of creative curiosity,

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.989
the right data and diligence and coding or

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.744
using another tool to assist in finding the correct solution.

00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:32.745
Here, we use the leading to in industry which is Python.

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:35.244
But you could use R, Tableau,

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:37.875
or any other tool that analyzes data.

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:42.564
The best solution is one that's accessible for those around you to act on.

00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:46.684
These top four are needed for all data science problems;

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:48.850
these two are tools.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.719
Though they're very powerful and currently surrounded by a lot of hype,

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.424
they aren't going to provide the answer to every question.

00:00:56.424 --> 00:01:01.164
The best data scientist tend to have mastery of many of these fields,

00:01:01.164 --> 00:01:04.670
but it is also possible for data scientists to be very

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.284
focused in their responsibilities to one of these disciplines.

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:12.109
Data science teams may be comprised of experts that work in

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:16.159
niche areas related to any one of these areas.
