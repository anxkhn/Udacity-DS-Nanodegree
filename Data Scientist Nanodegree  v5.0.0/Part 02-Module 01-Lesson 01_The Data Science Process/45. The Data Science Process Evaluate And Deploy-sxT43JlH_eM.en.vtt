00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.025
There are two main ways you can utilize the results of your analysis.

00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:12.960
One way is to deploy your model to automate tasks.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.150
Those tasks might be serving

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.719
an appropriate advertisement to a customer or recommending a movie.

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:23.589
You will learn more about deploying models later in this program.

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.079
The second way to utilize the results of an analysis is to communicate

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.449
your insights from your data to persuade

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.450
others to make a decision or take a certain action.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.575
This will be the focus of your upcoming project.

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:38.855
To communicate with other programmers,

00:00:38.854 --> 00:00:41.169
it's important to share your ideas and code.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.625
For this, you can use GitHub.

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:47.659
To communicate with managers and others within your company,

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.679
you will need to persuade them with written ideas and visuals.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.090
For this, it is common to use dashboards and emails.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.365
To practice these skills and build your portfolio,

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:02.880
you will be creating a post which we'll do on Medium.
