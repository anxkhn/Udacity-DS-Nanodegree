00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:11.609
In other cases, it might be acceptable to drop values associated with data entry errors,

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:16.454
mechanical issues or because the missing data isn't useful for our question of interest.

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:17.879
An example of this,

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:22.059
might be if we were measuring running pace of an individual based on GPS.

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:25.854
They go through a wooded area without a GPS signal,

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:31.204
dropping these values might be better than imputing the values that actually aren't true.

00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:34.274
Imputing values here is basically just lying.

00:00:34.274 --> 00:00:36.979
Lukma aren't super-fast today,

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:41.519
were not real, but I made numbers that makes it look like I did.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.280
Dropping these values would be reasonable and depending on how much data you collect,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.094
it might not matter much at all.

00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:52.265
Another example, might be if we were interested in predicting the price,

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:53.850
people pay for cars.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.990
But some people don't own cars.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.085
Well now, we can drop these rows, no problem.

00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:02.530
These individuals do not help answer our question of interest.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.219
In this case, the NaN value is useful as an indicator for people who don't have cars.

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.439
These two cases are both acceptable cases for dropping missing values.
