00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900
Now that you're more familiar with the data,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.455
you might have come up with some questions that you are interested in answering.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:14.800
This strategy is one of two ways to arrive at questions of interests.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.984
Alternatively, you might not have any data,

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.964
but you might have questions that are particularly interesting,

00:00:20.964 --> 00:00:24.335
in which case, you will want to collect the necessary data,

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:26.375
to be able to answer those questions.

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:28.719
Here, were some that I came up with,

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:30.414
as we were looking through the data.

00:00:30.414 --> 00:00:35.784
First, what do those employed in industry suggest to help others enter the field?

00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:39.369
Second, what does the data suggest about boot camp grads,

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:41.799
in terms of job placement and salary?

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:44.769
Third, what are the aspects of an individual,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.665
that best correlate to salary?

00:00:46.664 --> 00:00:48.524
How well can we predict salary,

00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:50.664
using the other columns in the dataset?

00:00:50.664 --> 00:00:55.814
And finally, what factors are most related to having high job satisfaction?

00:00:55.814 --> 00:00:58.804
We can then move these questions into the data.

00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:03.729
This first means that we'll need to take a closer look at the cousin education column.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.140
The second question uses the time after boot camp column and the salary column.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.165
Though we might need to control for

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:14.080
other information that's available throughout the dataset,

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.164
like years of experience or programming languages.

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:22.790
The third and final questions might use any or all of the columns in the dataset.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.335
We will need to find a way to compare many of the columns in the dataset to one another.

00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:31.219
If you think you know how you might answer these questions,

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.170
feel free to tackle them on your own.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.439
I'll show you my approach using the crispy-M process in the sections that follow.
