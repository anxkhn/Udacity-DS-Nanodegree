00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:08.689
For this lesson, you will get hands-on practice with a dataset from

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.480
Stack Overflow developer survey results, from 2017.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.730
The data for this example is available in

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.699
the Resources tab for you to follow along on your machine,

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.925
as well as in the workspaces in the classroom.

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:25.144
The data was collected by providing a survey to developers on Stack overflow's website.

00:00:25.144 --> 00:00:28.015
A quick look at the columns in the dataset provides

00:00:28.015 --> 00:00:31.120
a number of questions that we might ask.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.905
This dataset, can provide some insight and to developers around the world,

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:38.500
and get you an idea of their experiences.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.085
Anything from their advice to other developers,

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:42.734
to how they learn new skills,

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:46.094
to where they live, or what programming languages they use,

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:48.750
can all be understood from this dataset.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.670
You will use the workspace and quizzes in

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.760
the following sections to familiarize yourself with the data,

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:57.679
and we will answer a few questions that I found interesting.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.950
But you should feel free to branch from

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.439
my analysis and explore questions that you are most interested in.
