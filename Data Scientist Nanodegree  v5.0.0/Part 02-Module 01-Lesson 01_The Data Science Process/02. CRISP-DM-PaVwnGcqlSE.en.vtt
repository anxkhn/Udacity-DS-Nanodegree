00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
Given the large number

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.495
of industries and problems that fall under the umbrella of Data Science,

00:00:09.494 --> 00:00:12.989
there are a lot of different tools and individual nuances of

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.875
a particular company or industry for finding solutions.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:22.875
However, there's actually a common process used to find many solutions in Data Science.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:29.339
This process is known as the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining or CRISP-DM.

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.549
This process has been an industry standard for analyzing data

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.884
for years and it has six major phases.

00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:38.849
First, developing business understanding.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.575
Second, developing data understanding.

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:44.675
Third, prepping your data to be analyzed.

00:00:44.674 --> 00:00:46.894
Fourth, modeling the data.

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:52.280
Fifth, evaluating the results to answer your questions of interest and finally,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.454
deploying changes based on the results of your analysis.

00:00:55.454 --> 00:01:00.320
We will look at each of these phases a bit closer in upcoming lessons.
