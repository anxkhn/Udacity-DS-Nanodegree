00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.710
Our goal for this course is to have

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.379
current and aspiring data scientists learn how

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.600
to work with large datasets using "Apache Spark."

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.829
We're both Data Engineers at Insight Data Science.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.079
We run a fellowship that helps programmers

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.294
learn big data technologies and distributed computing.

00:00:22.295 --> 00:00:25.050
We work side-by-side with data scientists and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.670
the entire data community to solve real-world problems.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.364
Learning Spark can be challenging.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:34.410
We had been working with it as it has developed and have

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.894
hundreds of fellows learn Spark in the past couple of years.

00:00:37.895 --> 00:00:40.670
We are excited to have you do the same.
