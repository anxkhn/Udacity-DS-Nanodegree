00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:06.044
Hi. I'm David.

00:00:06.044 --> 00:00:08.865
And I am Judith. Welcome to our Spark course.

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:11.039
We are really excited to get started.

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:15.224
Data is everywhere and it's growing every second of every day.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:20.504
Imagine 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is created every single day.

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:23.564
That's a lot of zeros, 18 to be exact.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.995
According to a recent IBM report,

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:30.615
90 percent of the world's data has been created in the last two years alone.

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:32.684
This data comes from all of us.

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:35.655
Our apps, social media, and connected devices,

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:37.939
all generate massive amounts of data that

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:40.884
tells about ourselves and how we interact with each other.

00:00:40.884 --> 00:00:44.659
This data contains valuable information and has changed

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.214
how businesses think about building and developing products.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:51.845
Our own data drives the technology we use every day.

00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:55.369
Analyzing data at such a large scale is challenging.

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:58.129
Data sets no longer fit on a single computer.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.275
Instead, we have to divide data across a network of distributed computers.

00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:05.959
New technologies like Spark were invented to

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:09.009
solve this problem and have become the industry standard.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.810
Spark has grown from an academic project in

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.085
Berkeley's Amp lab to a top open source project in just a few years.

00:01:16.084 --> 00:01:18.979
Now it's used by the largest companies and fast

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.875
growing startups all over the world to efficiently analyze messy data sets.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:26.989
In this course, you'll learn how to use Spark to work with

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:31.199
big data and build machine learning models at scale.
