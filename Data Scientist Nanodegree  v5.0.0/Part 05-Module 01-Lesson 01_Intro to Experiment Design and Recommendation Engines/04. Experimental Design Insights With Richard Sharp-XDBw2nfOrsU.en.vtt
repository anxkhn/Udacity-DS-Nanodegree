00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.879
First thing we do is we work closely with our marketing partners.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.330
They are interested in a number of different things that might be tested.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.070
There's always new ideas,

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.230
and there are a couple different categories of those new ideas too,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.199
or the major requests so a new feature in the app or

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.439
a substantial change to the loyalty program would

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.020
mean quite a bit of work not just on the data science side,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.190
not just on the modeling side,

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:36.689
but also everyone around the building would be impacted,

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:38.879
and more importantly, customers and the partners and

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.250
our stores would be impacted by it too.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.000
So, first question is the customer going to get it, right?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.579
Pretty much any customer facing change that we produce is

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.004
going to end up being a question that goes to a barista somewhere.

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:56.045
So, is this experiment going to

00:00:56.045 --> 00:01:00.829
impact the operations in the stores is another thing that we have to be considering.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.430
So, we do have a lot of data.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.100
We have data coming in from different sources,

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:10.009
we have data coming in from the stores themselves,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.840
there's inventory data, there's data from the registers,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.540
there's data comes in from the app.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.750
It comes in from many places.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.045
We do take a look at this and try and decide is there some sort of historical precedent?

00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:28.945
Is there some reason for hope this idea is going to work out?

00:01:28.944 --> 00:01:31.664
Next question, can we measure the result?

00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:34.780
Any great idea, we can put it out there,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.799
but are we going to be able to tell if it worked or not?

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.899
So, another operational constraint there.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.020
I would hope that most of the time,

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:46.884
most experiments would fail.

00:01:46.885 --> 00:01:49.370
It's pretty normal.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.050
If we had an idea that we were so certain would work,

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.504
and if we had 10 such ideas like that and nine of them worked,

00:01:56.504 --> 00:01:58.155
why weren't we already doing them?

00:01:58.155 --> 00:01:59.620
Those are the obvious things.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.430
Data science is here to uncover the less obvious.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.620
So, yes.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.540
We run experiments all the time.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.375
Now, they don't typically fail in grand fashion.

00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:10.490
It's not usually a disaster,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.500
but very often, the result is little to minimal change.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.189
Even if you get a somewhat positive result,

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:22.960
is it worth the effort to take that experiment and lift it into the production setting?

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.230
Demographic feature is a broadly term.

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.509
So, how long has someone been a member of the program, for example.

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:33.664
Then, treatment history.

00:02:33.664 --> 00:02:36.299
What have we tried showing you before?

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.579
So, somebody, maybe not specifically which exact to offer have we shown you before,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.580
but somebody who is in a group that is used to receiving offers

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.960
behaves differently than somebody in a group who's not used to receiving offers.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.750
Time is a variable that matters an awful lot to us.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.175
In fact, we're about to enter your holiday period.

00:02:58.175 --> 00:03:01.250
People behave very differently at Starbucks between Thanksgiving and

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.694
Christmas in the US than they do during the rest of the year.

00:03:05.694 --> 00:03:12.039
So, a control that is somebody might make a good control in October,

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:16.289
but a poor control in November for those sorts of reasons.
