00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Before we jump in and learn how to implement the techniques of

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.275
experimental design and recommendation engines ourselves,

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:09.060
we're going to hear from Dan,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.440
who's worked as a data scientist for Twitter,

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.064
Airbnb, and now Coinbase.

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:18.524
We'll get some insight on his experiences running experiments.

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:21.689
One of the reasons why experimentation is so hard,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.420
there's not just a single algorithm that you can follow,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.190
to be like, "Okay, this is like the test.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.115
It always works no matter what." Not going to happen.

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:32.324
Fortunately for data scientists. We stop jobs.

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:37.545
So, instead, acknowledging those concerns and letting

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:43.814
the data scientists configure certain solutions and also revealing the underlying data.

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:46.515
So, I can say, "All right, here is user ID,

00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:47.774
number of things bought,

00:00:47.774 --> 00:00:49.424
and they were in the treatment group.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:53.029
That's like the low level data that you can then build your own solution on as well,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.570
if that's something you need to do for their case.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.784
Let's say you have some treatment, some control group,

00:00:58.784 --> 00:01:02.929
maybe that's for some change to your landing page, or something like that,

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.349
or change to some page where a user's making a decision,

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:09.334
and what someone in the treatment group gets

00:01:09.334 --> 00:01:13.250
looks different than what somebody in a control group gets or something like that.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.515
So, you get all of these results.

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:18.394
How do you determine when you end?

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:19.670
How do you determine, "Okay,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.359
now we have enough data let's turn off the experiment.

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:24.980
Everyone should move to this page.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.870
We know that this is the better of the pages."

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.404
Yes, definitely when setting up experiments,

00:01:29.403 --> 00:01:32.060
one of the things we encourage is people to set

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.954
up all of the metrics that they can ahead of time.

00:01:34.954 --> 00:01:39.545
Especially, indicate one or two that are your decision metrics.

00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:42.280
So, basically, you've committed yourself to,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.409
"All right, if these metrics move in the way that I want them to,

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.769
and are maybe are like core business metrics,

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:51.905
either move positively or not negatively,

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:56.435
then it's a situation where I can be pretty confident that I want to watch".

00:01:56.435 --> 00:02:02.430
That being said, we also need to make sure that those metrics have enough data.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.040
So, at that point, you have a couple options,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.150
first of is doing power calculations ahead of time and

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.319
making sure that you have enough users to make those decisions.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.394
So, for example, you might want to say at that time, "All right,

00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:18.755
I want to make sure that sales doesn't move more than one percent."

00:02:18.754 --> 00:02:20.449
So, how many users do I need?

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:22.669
Roughly how many people hit my landing page?

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.399
I can make a pretty simple projection, just say, "All right,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.310
I'm going to need to run this for two weeks,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.860
and at that point it can look at the metrics site designated

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.730
At that point, I think this gets into the teams,

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:38.549
but at that point are you talking to someone else and saying,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.320
"Here's the data that we have regarding this.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.014
Now, you make a decision.

00:02:43.014 --> 00:02:44.964
Here's our recommendations."

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:48.409
Obviously, there are a lot of parts of the business that you're working with.

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.199
So, do you ultimately make those decisions?

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.789
Does someone else make those decisions?

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.759
Is that team thing in a lot of companies?

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.699
That's a great question. I think there's a lot of variation.

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:04.484
But largely, product teams typically are running these experiments.

00:03:04.485 --> 00:03:07.400
The data scientists responsible for saying,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.235
"Okay, these are the things that are relevant to measure,

00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:12.740
and here's how we're going to measure them both

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.400
from data flow perspective and a statistical perspective."

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.330
At the end, often a product manager ends up making the final decision

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.605
with input from the data scientist, engineering implications.

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:27.109
Also, if they do need to coordinate across teams,

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.125
if say my change is hurting some other teams metric,

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:32.819
there can be a conversation with that other team.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.549
That really brings in a lot of communication components to your role as a data scientist,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.250
that maybe a lot of people don't think that they'll be

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.460
doing on a regular basis, which is interesting.
