00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.425
As a final step for this lesson.

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:10.769
We'll take a look at moving all of our code over into

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.899
a module that anyone can easily use to make recommendations.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.635
We will want the module to contain a class,

00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:19.980
that we can import and use to make

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.714
recommendations in much the way you've interacted with scikit-learn.

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:27.390
You will want to be able to instantiate, fit,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.570
and predict a rating without having to think about

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.215
the struggle you just went through to build out your recommendation system.

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:38.060
There are a lot of different ways you might choose to structure your code,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.469
and you are now getting to the point in this program

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.094
where there aren't really right answers.

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:46.009
At the end of writing your class you should be

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.164
able to take the reviews and movies datasets,

00:00:49.164 --> 00:00:53.420
fit your recommendation system and make a predicted rating for

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.630
user-movie combination and also provide

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.000
a recommended list of movies for any user ID that you're given.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.049
There might be reasons to structure your class in any of a number of ways.

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.409
Feel free to be creative with your own solution to

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.965
create something completely different than the template allows.

00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:14.990
This is an open-ended task.

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:17.359
See what you can put together
