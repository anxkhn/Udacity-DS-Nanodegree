00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
In this notebook, we're going to take a look at how we can use

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.445
the built-ins in Python to perform singular value decomposition.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:11.190
So, to get started, we'll read in our data set.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:13.919
Notice that we're reading in the movies and

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.649
reviews datasets that you used in the last lesson.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:23.368
But then we're actually going to subset them down to only a few different movies,

00:00:23.368 --> 00:00:27.074
and we'll store that information in this user movie subset.

00:00:27.074 --> 00:00:30.599
This is the thing that we're going to be using throughout the rest of this notebook.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.660
So, to get started, we'll answer a few questions about

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.609
the user movie subset and make

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:38.914
sure that we understand the dataset then we're going to be working with.

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:41.210
The first question here is,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.954
what's the number of users in the user movie subset?

00:00:43.954 --> 00:00:47.519
That should be user_movie zero.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.560
So, it looks like there's 20 there,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.750
the number of movies is four,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.700
which I saw on that first part.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.804
But we could add to stop one here and we get that.

00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:03.710
The user ID with the highest average ratings given.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.215
So, if we do mean axis equals one.

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:14.545
Looks like user 265 has an average rating of 10.

00:01:14.545 --> 00:01:17.730
That's e are equal,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.590
the movie ID with the highest average ratings received.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.615
If I change this to zero,

00:01:23.614 --> 00:01:25.534
it looks like that this movie,

00:01:25.534 --> 00:01:33.280
68646, which is b and the name of the movie.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:45.480
From the movies, if I grab the movie ID is equal to b,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.685
and then I'll just pull the movie name,

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:50.430
which is in the movie column.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.820
Oh! So, it looks like it's the godfather.
