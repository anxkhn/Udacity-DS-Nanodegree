00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.695
In the previous notebook,

00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:09.880
you got a glimpse of some of the issues that still remain

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.585
when making predictions using matrix factorization techniques.

00:00:13.585 --> 00:00:18.300
New users and movies are being added to our database all the time,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.269
and matrix factorization techniques aren't going to work in making

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.695
predictions for these users and movies because they don't have any ratings yet.

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:29.699
SVD has two major benefits.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.549
The first is that it gives a predicted rating for all of

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:39.004
our user-movie pairs even when the total number of ratings is very sparse.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:43.810
Second, it gives a way to evaluate how good those ratings

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.520
actually are using traditional metrics

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.415
you've seen in regression machine learning techniques.

00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:52.879
Despite this, there's still the problem that we're left

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.745
without predicted ratings for new users and movies.

00:00:56.744 --> 00:01:00.750
This is a common problem known as the cold start problem.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.590
In general, collaborative filtering methods

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.920
just don't work for making recommendations in these cases.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.995
Instead, we'll need to use

00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:14.520
knowledge-based or content-based recommendations like you saw in the last lesson.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:16.204
In the next notebook,

00:01:16.204 --> 00:01:18.560
you'll create a blended approach for making

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.855
recommendations using collaborative filtering with SVD,

00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:23.810
as well as knowledge and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.640
content-based recommendations for dealing with the cold start problem.
