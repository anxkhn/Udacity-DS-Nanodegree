00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.770
In the last lesson,

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:09.939
you've gain foundational skills and recommendation engines.

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:15.009
In this lesson, we're going to focus on a few questions that are still left open.

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.245
The first of these questions is,

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:19.780
how do we know when our recommendations are good?

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.495
The second is, how do we use machine learning techniques to make recommendations?

00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:29.410
The third question, we explored a bit in the last lesson,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.105
but not in a lot of detail.

00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:33.160
That question is, how do we make

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:36.714
recommendations for individuals when they're new to our platform?

00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:39.385
This is called the Cold Start Problem.

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:42.729
We'll look at some ways to make recommendations in these cases.

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:45.619
With that, let's get started.
