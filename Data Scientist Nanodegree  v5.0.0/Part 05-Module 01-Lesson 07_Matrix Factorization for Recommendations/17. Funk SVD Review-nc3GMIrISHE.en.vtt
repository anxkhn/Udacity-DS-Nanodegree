00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.820
Your newly created Funk SVD function is great and that you've gained

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.460
the fundamental ideas associated with making

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.415
predictions using singular value decomposition,

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:18.289
and that you can make those predictions even when you have missing values.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.599
Being able to build out your own machine learning algorithms from

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.020
scratch is a necessary skill for data scientists.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.509
In the next notebook,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.679
we're going to see just how well your algorithm performs in practice.
