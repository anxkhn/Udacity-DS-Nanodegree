00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:07.865
Before we dive into singular value decomposition,

00:00:07.865 --> 00:00:10.445
it's important to understand latent factors.

00:00:10.445 --> 00:00:14.339
A latent factor is not actually observed in our data,

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.824
rather, we infer it based on the ratings users give to items.

00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:23.140
What are possible latent factors that are related to the movies in our data set?

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.580
One latent factor might be that a movie is sad,

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.183
or that it's about artificial intelligence,

00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:31.660
or that a movie stars Meryl Streep,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.920
or that it has a puppy in it,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.350
or latent factor might be that there's a movie that has a Canadian actor named Ryan.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.219
These aren't data points that are directly in our data,

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.269
but we might be able to find as latent factors.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.545
For example, if you look at the movie, The Notebook,

00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:55.030
you'll notice that the movie both has a Canadian Ryan and scenes that'll make you cry,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.660
while this movie called A.I.

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.468
has Meryl Streep and artificial intelligence.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.454
Alternatively, latent factors might also be related to users' preferences.

00:01:07.454 --> 00:01:09.359
If we look at Jesse,

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:14.084
we can see that she has positive ratings related to the latent factors of dogs,

00:01:14.084 --> 00:01:16.914
Canadian Ryans, and sad movies,

00:01:16.915 --> 00:01:19.395
while Sam likes AI,

00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:22.469
Meryl Streep and also likes dogs.

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.390
The idea of finding how movies and users relate to

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.040
latent factors is central to how we make predictions using SVD.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.720
In the next video,

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:38.670
we'll take a closer look at how these relationships show up when performing SVD.
