00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.439
In this lesson, you will be using a technique called

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.975
Singular Value Decomposition to make recommendations.

00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:16.364
The math associated with singular value decomposition can be pretty complex.

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:21.379
The main goal is for you to be able to use this technique to make recommendations.

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:25.549
Since knowing the math inside and out isn't really the goal here,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.685
we'll look at some of the math associated with this technique,

00:00:28.684 --> 00:00:32.240
and then I'll add additional resources throughout the lesson,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.660
if you decide you want to dive into the details.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.894
So, the first thing I want do here,

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:39.950
is to motivate you to understand why we would use

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.265
singular value decomposition to make recommendations.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:45.304
In the early 2000s,

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:49.054
Netflix released a data set with just three columns.

00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:52.039
Much like the reviews dataset you've been working with,

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.174
but with many more rows.

00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:56.669
They offered a million dollar prize to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.039
the person or team who could make the best recommendations.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.744
I remember at the time,

00:01:02.744 --> 00:01:04.109
I was at Iowa State,

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:09.069
and a group of my professors had teamed up and we're working on making recommendations.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.629
With much of the leaders belonging to these large research teams,

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:15.444
an individual by the name of Simon Funk,

00:01:15.444 --> 00:01:17.524
remained amongst the top ten.

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:20.435
The algorithm he used to make his recommendations

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:23.754
was none other than the one you'll learn in this lesson.

00:01:23.754 --> 00:01:29.399
Known as Funk Singular Value Decomposition or FunkSVD.
