00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
We're actually partnering with IBM to build

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.209
this really great project for everyone to utilize in the classroom.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:09.839
Can you give us a little insight into the platform that they'll be

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.369
using and the data that they'll be getting out of it.

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.449
Right. Yeah. So, the project is cool.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.070
I like the project.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.199
I thought it was a great idea when we got started working on it. What is the project?

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.699
Well, on Watson Studio, an important component,

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.474
as we discussed, is the community.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:33.755
The community is collaborative ecosystem of curated datasets, articles, notebooks.

00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:37.130
Other kinds of assets that are out there in the world of Data Science,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.375
Machine Learning, and artificial intelligence.

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:44.505
Our users on the platform interact with these assets.

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:47.760
So, what the students are building and what we've built,

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:52.934
is a recommendation system for these assets in the community.

00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:55.340
One thing is that what we do is,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.785
we go out there ourselves and we curate also with models that we develop here at IBM.

00:01:01.784 --> 00:01:04.459
All these assets that are out there.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:09.049
What students will be doing is building in that part where it makes it personal for

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.879
an individual user and providing

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:14.409
that personalized recommendation experience with a Web App.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.200
So, it sounds like this is actually something that isn't on your platform,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.010
but could be really useful to people on your platform.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.200
Yeah. That's right.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.790
Now that's very cool. Students will be working on a recommendation system

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.090
to personalize recommendations for people who are already in the community.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.034
That's right. Yes. So, the data that they'll have is

00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:35.840
anonymized data of the interactions

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.359
between all of the different kinds of articles and datasets,

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.974
and that sort of thing we have in the community, and our users.

00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:45.390
So there's that communication between what they're actually doing on the platform

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.909
interacting with those assets and all of that is actually

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.840
part of the data that they'll take advantage of.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.930
So, that's pretty exciting,.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.820
I think. Yeah, sounds like a really cool project.

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:54.964
Yeah.

00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:58.045
It also sounds like,

00:01:58.045 --> 00:02:02.260
students will be able to tackle this recommendation system.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.880
However, they might want to which could be like looking a how users are connected,

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:08.439
how articles are connected,

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.944
how different types of media are connected.

00:02:10.944 --> 00:02:11.709
That's right.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.409
There's like lots of different ways that they could go about creating a solution.

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:16.250
Yeah.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.939
Very cool.
