Today, we're using data science

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:06.830
to reach people trapped in the most devastating of circumstances.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.699
Medical treatments are advancing at a rigorous pace,

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:13.589
thanks to a deeper data-driven understanding of the human body.

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.350
Armed with data, companies are improving

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.970
user experiences and building better products to power the future.
