00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
So, I'm here with Robert from Airbnb.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.940
Robert, thanks so much for joining us.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:04.939
Thank you for having me.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.790
So, I know that you have actually quite a few posts on Medium

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:13.214
that have a lot of people who read them and follow your work,

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:18.250
can you talk about how you got started with that?

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:24.015
What are some of the ways that you go about sharing your information? Things like that.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:28.000
So, I wrote my first public posts in 2015,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.394
and it was about my experience working as a data scientist at Twitter,

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:41.680
and it was meant to be a reflection of my journey for myself,

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:47.310
but then eventually it got retweeted by a famous data scientists,

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.160
and then it went viral, unexpectedly.

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.664
I think that gave me some courage to keep writing,

00:00:54.664 --> 00:01:02.149
and what I've noticed so far in all my pursuit in writing

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.840
about data science is I generally write about subjects

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.174
that I struggled to learn in the past.

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:13.685
For example, I am very passionate about data engineering,

00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:16.060
but few years back,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.454
it's very hard for me to find useful information,

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:23.030
but then I am very fortunate to work at Airbnb,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.500
work with many very smart data engineers,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.075
and I've learned a lot from them.

00:01:28.075 --> 00:01:34.150
So, I decided to just synthesize and write down everything that I know about the subject.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.505
One is to for me,

00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:40.189
for myself internalize what I've learned and to celebrate it a little bit,

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:46.659
and then the second part is just to make information more available to other people.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.435
Yeah, I think Holly Wicham had a quote, not a quote sorry,

00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:55.019
had a tweet which he said things are useful,

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:58.539
doesn't have to just be a complete new software, sometimes it's documentation.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.690
Sometimes there's just explaining how things work.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.450
I really echo with that,

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.550
because I really benefit a lot from people who can explain things really well,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.445
and who can articulate things really well to me so that I can learn this stuff.

00:02:14.444 --> 00:02:17.000
Then you do it to a whole broad audience.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.990
Yeah, I hope I contribute a little bit to that, yeah.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.270
So, do you have any advice for people who are

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.540
just getting started with writing their own post?

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:27.669
There's a lot of benefits of putting your work out there,

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.939
because you will get unexpected feedback and sometimes you will get

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.859
unexpected attention or opportunities.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.110
So, I think this is true if you're early in your career,

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.760
or your had been in industry for a few years.

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:49.500
Just sharing stuff in general I think it's really valuable,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.229
and it's something that's generally,

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:57.090
I think that's something that's quite special about Tech in Silicon Valley in general,

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.395
just like people are very willing to share information,

00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:02.880
and there's a lot of benefits from that.
