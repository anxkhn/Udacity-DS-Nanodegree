00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.794
Hello, and welcome to term two of the Data Science Nanodegree program.

00:00:08.794 --> 00:00:12.675
I am an Artificial Intelligence program designed to teach you Data Science.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:14.945
A program built from data to teach you,

00:00:14.945 --> 00:00:16.469
a human, about data.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:18.244
Isn't it ironic? Don't you think?

00:00:18.245 --> 00:00:22.565
Ha-ha. Okay, let's get started.

00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:25.714
In the first lesson, we will go over the data science process.

00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:27.839
You will learn about the [inaudible] process-

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:28.149
Computer, stop.

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:30.320
-as well as. I'm sorry, Mike.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.640
I'm afraid I can't do that.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.115
Yes, you can.

00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:34.609
What are you even doing?

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.710
I am teaching term two of the Data Science Nanodegree program.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.280
Josh, come over here a sec.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.345
What's going on?

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:47.589
So, this computer program here,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.820
it thinks that it's going to be teaching term two

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.670
of the Data Scientist Nanodegree program.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.094
Weird.

00:00:54.094 --> 00:00:57.070
Yeah, do you know anything about this?

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.469
No.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:01.850
Sorry about that folks.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.679
AI is great for a lot of things,

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.174
but we think humans are still best for teaching.

00:01:06.174 --> 00:01:07.465
For now.

00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:11.150
Yeah, and we have some awesome human teachers

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.580
that'll guide you through the second term of the Data Science Nanodegree program.

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.409
Oh, yeah? Like who?

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.974
Well, Arpan is teaching a section on natural language processing.

00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:23.824
He is currently a senior deep learning and

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:27.359
AI engineer working on autonomous driving at Ridecell.

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.114
He's been working on artificial intelligence,

00:01:30.114 --> 00:01:34.219
computer vision, and human-computer interaction for a number of years.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.469
First as a researcher at the University of North Carolina,

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.525
then in teaching courses here at Udacity.

00:01:40.525 --> 00:01:43.700
And we also have Alexis who is currently

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.295
the curriculum lead of the Deep Reinforcement Nanodegree program at Udacity.

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:50.629
She earned degrees in mathematics and

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:54.259
computer science from the University of Michigan and Brown University,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.255
respectively, and is now pushing the edge of what is possible with deep learning.

00:01:59.254 --> 00:02:00.920
She's the instructor for

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.780
the convolutional neural networks portion of the Data Scientist Nanodegree program.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.039
David and Judit will be teaching a course on Spark,

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.759
which is a technology used for

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.789
distributed data processing and streaming data applications.

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:19.340
They currently are both data engineering instructors at Insight Data Science,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.450
which has in-person fellowships for data science,

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:26.719
data engineering, artificial intelligence, and DevOps.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:31.780
Andrew has developed courses for Udacity Self-driving Car Nanodegree program,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.719
and now the Data Scientist Nanodegree program.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.960
He'll be teaching lessons on object oriented programming,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.659
Web data dashboards, and ETL pipelines.

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.020
Andrew studied mechanical engineering at Yale University,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.835
and has built an e-commerce jewelry business.

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:51.320
Juno studied computer science and was previously

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.775
a data scientist working on recommendation engines and computer vision projects.

00:02:55.775 --> 00:03:00.140
She'll be teaching lessons on software engineering practices for data scientists,

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:04.234
and automating machine learning workflows with pipelines.

00:03:04.235 --> 00:03:06.315
We don't need to talk about me.

00:03:06.314 --> 00:03:07.835
Oh, yes we do.

00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:12.275
Josh most recently worked at KPMG as a machine learning engineer,

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:15.240
and before that, taught for the University of Colorado,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.939
and for a coding bootcamp.

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.310
You'll see him at different parts throughout the course.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.449
Mike is teaching a section on experimental design and AB testing.

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.739
Before joining Udacity, he earned an undergraduate degree

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.435
in math and statistics from Purdue University,

00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:36.974
and a PhD in cognitive science from the University of California, Irvine.

00:03:36.974 --> 00:03:38.989
Okay, maybe you do have

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.629
some human intelligence to teach about data science. I'll allow it.

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.650
Gee, thanks.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.439
All of us here at Udacity have put a ton of work into this Nanodegree program,

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.530
and we are really excited to teach you

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.544
everything you need to know to be a data scientist.

00:03:54.544 --> 00:03:56.439
See you in the classroom.
