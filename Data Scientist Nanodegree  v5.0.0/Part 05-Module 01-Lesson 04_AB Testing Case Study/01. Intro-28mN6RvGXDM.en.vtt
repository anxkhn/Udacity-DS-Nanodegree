00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:07.365
In the previous lessons,

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:10.259
you've learned about conceptual and statistical components

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.339
that go in designing and analyzing an experiment.

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.359
In this lesson, you'll see how the things you've learned can be used in a case study.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.960
You'll be led through the design process for a web-based experiment.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.880
From thinking about the user funnel,

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:25.349
coming up with metrics,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.385
and estimating how long the experiment will need to be run.

00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:30.840
Then you'll analyze collected data,

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.590
performing inferential statistics on both invariant and evaluation

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.240
metrics in order to come up with

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.120
some conclusions about the experiment. So let's get to it.
