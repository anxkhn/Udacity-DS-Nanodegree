00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240
Congratulations, you've done a great job

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.089
applying the skills that you've learned in this course.

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.820
What you've seen is just one of the many ways in

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.745
which an experiment can be designed and run.

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:20.160
Don't feel limited by the examples given in

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.280
this course as the only way to create an experiment.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.019
Instead, keep in mind

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.144
the conceptual and statistical principles as driving guidelines for your own experiments.

00:00:30.144 --> 00:00:32.714
Use what you've learned here as a foundation,

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:37.480
and keep on building up as you move forward in your data science career.
