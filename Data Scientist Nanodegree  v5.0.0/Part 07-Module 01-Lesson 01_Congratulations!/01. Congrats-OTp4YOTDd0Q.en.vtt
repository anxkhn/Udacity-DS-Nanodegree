Congratulations on finishing the data scientists nano degree program.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.850
We're thrilled to see you here at the end.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.835
You should be incredibly proud of your accomplishments.

You have mastered so many skills to get to this point.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.410
From ramping up your communication skills and building better practices as

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.670
a software engineer to deploying machine learning applications.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.860
We are so glad you invited us on your journey as you

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.590
move closer to becoming a sorcerer in the world of data science.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.315
You now have an impressive portfolio of projects to show off.

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:33.820

imagine being able to do at the beginning of this journey.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.790
Build machine learning into new applications,

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.755
and plug your findings and learnings,

00:00:50.755 --> 00:00:53.760
and then share your data science skills with the community.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.890
This was a challenging journey,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.280
